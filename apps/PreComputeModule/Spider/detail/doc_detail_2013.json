[{"abstract": "ABSTRACT\nNowadays, the advance of social media has led to the explosive growth of opinion data. Therefore, sentiment analysis has attracted a lot of attentions. Currently, sentiment analysis applications are divided into two main approaches, the lexicon-based approach and the machine-learning approach. However, both of them face the challenge of obtaining a large amount of human-labeled training data and corpus. For the lexicon-based approach, it requires a sentiment lexicon to determine the opinion polarity. There are many existing benchmark sentiment lexicons, but they cannot cover all the domain-specific words meanings. Thus, automatic generation of a domain-specific sentiment lexicon becomes an important task. We propose a framework to automatically generate sentiment lexicon. First, we determine the semantic similarity between two words in the entire unlabeled corpus. We treat the words as nodes and similarities as weighted edges to construct word graphs. A graph-based semi-supervised label propagation method finally assigns the polarity to unlabeled words through the proposed propagation process. Experiments conducted on the microblog data, Twitter, show that our approach leads to a better performance than baseline approaches and general-purpose sentiment dictionaries.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2539150.2539190", "authors": ["Yen-Jen Tai\n,", "Hung-Yu Kao"], "references": ["A.

The novelty of this work is that agents are able to control topological features during the network formation phase. We propose a commitment-based dynamic coalition formation approach that result in a single coalition where agents mutually cooperate. Agents play an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with their immediate neighbors and offer commitments to their wealthiest neighbors in order to form coalitions. A commitment proposal, that includes a high breaching penalty, incentivizes opponent agents to form coalitions within which they mutually cooperate and thereby increase their payoff. We have analytically determined, and experimentally substantiated, how the value of the penalty should be set with respect to the minimum node degree and the payoff values such that convergence into optimal coalitions is possible. Using a computational model, we determine an appropriate partner selection strategy for the agents that results in a network facilitating the convergence into a single coalition and thereby maximizing average expected payoff.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.130", "authors": ["Mohammad Rashedul Hasan\n,", "Anita Raja"], "references": ["H.

So, when a player of a game chooses a strategy, it should consider not only the material or money payoff from taking the strategy and others' best response but also how feasible to take the strategy in the specific context where the game is played. To solve such a game, this paper establishes a model of fuzzily constrained games and introduces a solution concept of constrained equilibrium for the games of this kind. Our model can reflect the outcome of altruistic behavior and predict the outcome of a game played under fuzzy constraints precisely.

TF-IDF scores for each document that is linked to by a tweet (also termed twanchor [22] when the document is a news article) are calculated after they enter the system and pass initial classification filters. These scores are used to cluster similar tweets. Clusters must contain tweets from reputable sources in order for the clusters to form. These reputable sources are known as seeders as they essentially seed a cluster. Seeders have become an integral part of the TwitterStand architecture. An optimal system monitors the set of seeders in order to find newsworthy tweets quickly.\nThis paper proposes methods to improve the current list of seeders by augmenting the pool with previously undiscovered users while routinely eliminating those that do not bring any value. We consider a successful seeder one who is timely in the reporting of large newsworthy events. An analysis of the current seeders precedes a proposed approach and serves as the basis for quantifying future seeder churn. A qualitative analysis based on that approach is conducted in an effort to quantitatively evaluate the process.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2536689.2536808", "authors": ["Nick Gramsky\n,", "Hanan Samet"], "references": ["Buzztracker, http://buzztracker.org.", "Trendsmap, http://trendsmap.com.", "Pear analytics - twitter study. http://www.pearanalytics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Twitter-Study-August-2009.pdf, Aug. 2009.", "A high flying bird: Twitter breaks 140m users, 340m tweets per day. http://www.redherring.com/internet/a-high-flying-bird-twitter-breaks-140m-users-340m-tweets-per-day/, 2012.", "E.

However, tags are not present in significant portions of Web 2.0 objects, which may impact the effectiveness of such methods. This problem, known as cold start, is the focus of this paper. We here evaluate the impact of the cold start on a family of methods for recommending tags. Our results show that the effectiveness of these methods suffer greatly when they cannot rely on previously assigned tags in the target object and that the use of automatic filtering strategies to alleviate the problem yields limited gains. We then propose a new strategy that exploits both positive and negative relevance feedback (RF) from the users to iteratively select input tags to these methods. The results show that the proposed strategy generates significant gains (up to 45%) over the best considered baseline. It is also shown that the proposed method is robust to the lack of user cooperation.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2526188.2526189", "authors": ["Eder F. Martins\n,", "Fabiano M.

An existing GridFTP server is able to dynamically load this tool to support new functionality. Different queries types (query over dimensions, coordinates and values) are supported by our tool. A number of optimizations, like parallel indexing, performance model for data subsetting, and parallel streaming are also applied.

Such input methods restrict end users' search to predefined spatial boundaries. However in some scenarios, users' spatial information need do not only rely in specific places, but rather in the search and exploration of certain region of interest. A user might be interested in exploring a region he/she is already living in, or to search for other similar regions. In this paper we argue the need of more sophisticated query interfaces for GIR that abstracts from the places and support the search and exploration of relevant regions. To cater such user requirements we present spatial query definition on map interface that could provide interactive analysis, and relevance ranking of interesting regions.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2533888.2533940", "authors": ["Chandan Kumar\n,", "Wilko Heuten\n,", "Susanne Boll"], "references": ["D.

This leads to a serious question about the trustworthiness of information and sources. During the last decade, numerous models were proposed to model social trust in the service of social web. Trust modeling follows two main axes, local trust (trust between pair of users), and global trust (user's reputation within the community). Subjective logic, is an extension of probabilistic logic that deals with the cases of lack of evidences. An elaborated local trust model based on subjective logic already exists. The aim of this work is to apply this model to the first time on a real data set. Then, we propose another global trust model based also on subjective logic. We apply both models on a real data set of a question answering social network that aims to assist people to find solutions to their technical problems in various domains. Our proposed global trust model ensures a better performance thanks to its precise interpretation of the context of trust, and its ability to satisfy new arrived users.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.5", "authors": ["Charif Haydar\n,", "Azim Roussanaly\n,", "Anne Boyer"], "references": ["R.

One of the most common datasets used to gain business intelligence is event log files. Oftentimes, records in event log files that are time sorted, need to be grouped by user ID or transaction ID in order to mine user behaviors, such as click through rate, while preserving the time order. This kind of analytical workload is here referred to as RElative Order-pReserving based Grouping (Re-Org). Using MapReduce/Hadoop, a popular big data analysis tool, in an as-is manner for executing Re-Org tasks on ordered datasets is not efficient due to its internal sort-merge mechanism. We propose a framework that adopts an efficient group-order-merge mechanism to provide faster execution of Re-Org tasks and implement it by extending Hadoop. Experimental results show a 2.2x speedup over executing Re-Org tasks in plain vanilla Hadoop.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2462902.2462930", "authors": ["Jiangtao Yin\n,", "Yong Liao\n,", "Mario Baldi\n,", "Lixin Gao\n,", "Antonio Nucci"], "references": ["Apache Hadoop. http://hadoop.apache.org/.", "World Cup 1998. http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/WorldCup.html.", "J.

Full-text search is a powerful tool to access such knowledge. However, it often delivers too many results for general queries. Therefore we propose an approach to find relevant data by extracting metadata relevant for each page and allow to search for pages on the basis of their metadata as alternative to full-text search. Given the size of scanned data (high quality image scans) clearly this extraction cannot be done manually. As it turns out, although there are some common aspects, different books often need to be treated differently.

Taking the multi-species competition mechanism into consideration, this model treats the limited labeled data as heterogeneous ant colonies according to the predefined classes, these colonies live in their nests and communicate indirectly by their unique types of pheromone. The unlabeled data set is taken as the food resources, which transforms the conventional classification problem into the scramble for resources among multiple ant colonies. During the swarm random walk in such an environment, every nest fights against others by the accumulation of different class pheromone on these resources for the possessions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with real life benchmark datasets in terms of classification accuracy. Meanwhile the method is compared with other techniques. Experimental results show the potentiality of the proposed algorithm.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.126", "authors": ["Xiaohua Xu\n,", "Lin Lu\n,", "Ping He\n,", "Yue Ma\n,", "Qi Chen\n,", "Ling Chen"], "references": ["R.

In this paper, we focus on retrospective conversion of human-safety related data to crisis management knowledge. First, we study how Twitter data can be classified into the seven categories of the United Nations Development Program Security Model (i.e., Food, Health, Politics, Economic, Personal, Community, and Environment). We conclude that these topic categories are applicable, and supplementing them with classification of individual authors into more generic sources of data (i.e., Official authorities, Media, and Laypeople) allows curating data and assessing crisis maturity. Second, we introduce automated classifiers, based on supervised learning and decision rules, for both tasks and evaluate their correctness. This evaluation uses two datasets collected during the crises of Queensland floods and NZ Earthquake in 2011. The topic classifier performs well in the major categories (i.e., 120--190 training instances) of Economic (F = 0.76) and Community (F = 0.67) while in the minor categories (i.e., 0--60 training instances) the results are more modest (F ≤ 0.41). The source classifier shows excellent results (F ≥ 0.83) in all categories.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2537734.2537740", "authors": ["Karl Kreiner\n,", "Aapo Immonen\n,", "Hanna Suominen"], "references": ["Immonen, A., Bali, R.

The focus of this new method is to engage a researcher integrally in the analysis process and allow them to guide the identification and discovery of relevant behavior instances within multimodal data. The case studies resulted in the creation of two analysis strategies: Single-Focus Hypothesis Testing and Multi-Focus Hypothesis Testing. Each were shown to be beneficial to multimodal analysis through supporting either a single focused deep analysis or analysis across multiple angles in unison. These strategies exemplified how challenging questions can be answered for multimodal datasets. The new method is described and the case studies' findings are presented detailing how the new method supports multimodal analysis and opens the door for a new breed of analysis methods.

This fact implicates in an important issue -- video content overload. One way to treat such problem consists on the use of recommender systems. In this sense, this paper proposes a method to enhance the accuracy of the predictions given by video recommender systems by the use of Segments of Interest (SOI). Based on the premise that users tend to like particular segments of a video more than the entire video, and that they are able to mark these segments, these can be used to identify similar people, i.e. the ones who have similar interests about videos. This similarity can be used to enhance the accuracy of the ratings predictions of traditional collaborative video recommender systems. To evaluate this approach, an experimental evaluation was performed. The results showed that the accuracy improvement is directly related with the level of participation of people marking SOI. Thus, as more people collaborate and interact, better will be the recommendation result.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2526188.2526201", "authors": ["Alessandro da Silveira Dias\n,", "Leandro Krug Wives\n,", "Valter Roesler"], "references": ["Adomavicius G., Tuzhilin, A. 2005.

While the users of these services can look for the entities of interest on map interface via sequential search or browsing of individual categories, the visualization of multiple categories simultaneously is still not well supported. This limits the end users on abstracted view, exploration, and comparison of spatial areas with respect to multiple criteria of interests. In this research we investigate the end-user interaction for multi-criteria local search with two popular representations such as aggregated pixel and icon based visualizations. We present a grid-based interactive interface where users can select multiple criteria of interests and explore the relevant spatial regions via aggregated heatmap visualizations. We evaluate the design against icon/marker based visualization, which is an easy adaption of current commercial local search interfaces. We found that heatgrid visualization for local search performs as good as the more popular marker based interface. We report our findings on both visualizations regarding several user-centered aspects such as exploration ability, information overload and cognitive demand.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2534931.2534937", "authors": ["Chandan Kumar\n,", "Benjamin Poppinga\n,", "Daniel Haeuser\n,", "Wilko Heuten\n,", "Susanne Boll"], "references": ["D.

Existing studies on differential privacy mostly focus on simple aggregations such as counts. This paper investigates the publication of DP-compliant histograms, which is an important analytical tool for showing the distribution of a random variable, e.g., hospital bill size for certain patients. Compared to simple aggregations whose results are purely numerical, a histogram query is inherently more complex, since it must also determine its structure, i.e., the ranges of the bins. As we demonstrate in the paper, a DP-compliant histogram with finer bins may actually lead to significantly lower accuracy than a coarser one, since the former requires stronger perturbations in order to satisfy DP. Moreover, the histogram structure itself may reveal sensitive information, which further complicates the problem. Motivated by this, we propose two novel mechanisms, namely NoiseFirst and StructureFirst, for computing DP-compliant histograms. Their main difference lies in the relative order of the noise injection and the histogram structure computation steps. NoiseFirst has the additional benefit that it can improve the accuracy of an already published DP-compliant histogram computed using a naive method. For each of proposed mechanisms, we design algorithms for computing the optimal histogram structure with two different objectives: minimizing the mean square error and the mean absolute error, respectively. Going one step further, we extend both mechanisms to answer arbitrary range queries. Extensive experiments, using several real datasets, confirm that our two proposals output highly accurate query answers and consistently outperform existing competitors.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/s00778-013-0309-y", "authors": ["Jia Xu\n,", "Zhenjie Zhang\n,", "Xiaokui Xiao\n,", "Yin Yang\n,", "Ge Yu\n,", "Marianne Winslett"], "references": ["Barak, B., Chaudhuri, K., Dwork, C., Kale, S., McSherry, F., Talwar, K.: Privacy, accuracy, and consistency too: a holistic solution to contingency table release.

Recent work has shown that the syntactical approach performs well. In this paper, we show that Logic Programming, particularly Answer Set Programming (ASP), can be used to elegantly and efficiently implement the key components of syntax based aspect extraction. Specifically, the well known double propagation (DP) method is implemented using 8 ASP rules that naturally model all key ideas in the DP method. Our experiment on a widely used data set also shows that the ASP implementation is much faster than a Java-based implementation. Syntactical approach has its limitation too. To further improve the performance of syntactical approach, we identify a set of general words from Word Net that have little chance to be an aspect and prune them when extracting aspects. The concept of general words and their pruning are concisely captured by 10 new ASP rules, and a natural extension of the 8 rules for the original DP method. Experimental results show a major improvement in precision with almost no drop in recall compared with those reported in the existing work on a typical benchmark data set. Logic Programming provides a convenient and effective tool to encode and thus test knowledge needed to improve the aspect extraction methods so that the researchers can focus on the identification and discovery of new knowledge to improve aspect extraction.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.40", "authors": ["Qian Liu\n,", "Zhiqiang Gao\n,", "Bing Liu\n,", "Yuanlin Zhang"], "references": ["B.

Existing approaches broadly classify the user intent behind web queries into three categories: navigational, informational and transactional. In this study, we present a query classification framework that attempts to automatically determine the nature of the query. Assuming that the query has a predictable goal, our framework either classifies the goal into one of the three classes, or if the query goal is ambiguous, the framework predicts which classes have a high association with the given query. Our proposed approach deals with some of the limitations of previously reported methods by studying how users have interacted with the search results in the past. In this work, we first build and train an efficient web page classifier that categorizes a web page into navigational, informational or transactional classes by operating on twelve best distinguishing features selected through Correlation-based Feature Selection algorithm from a total of 152 url, html, lexical and bag of words features extracted from the click-through results of Yahoo-Bing search. We then analyzed the click-through results of Yahoo-Bing search engine with our classifier for a given set of queries and applied a set of fuzzy rules to classify the user goals behind the corresponding queries as either ambiguous or into any one of the known three classes. The goals for the same set of queries were manually classified through a questionnaire involving 50 participants. The initial results are compared and presented to show the efficiency of our proposed user goal identification technique.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2694476.2694508", "authors": ["Ariyam Das\n,", "Chittaranjan Mandal\n,", "Chris Reade"], "references": ["Andrei Broder.

For FIRE 2012, we submitted runs for the monolingual English and Hindi and the crosslingual English to Hindi subtasks. Compared to our experiments for FIRE 2011, our system was simplified by using a single retrieval engine (instead of three) and using a single approach for detection of out of domain queries (instead of three). In our approach, the SMS queries are transformed into a normalized, corrected form and submitted to a retrieval engine to obtain a ranked list of FAQ results. A classifier trained on features extracted from the training data then determines which queries are out of domain and which are not. For our crosslingual English to Hindi experiments, we trained a statistical machine translation system for Hindi to English translation to translate the full Hindi FAQ documents into English. The retrieval then operates on the corrected English input and retrieves results from the translated Hindi FAQ documents.\nOur best experiments achieved an MRR of 0.949 for the monolingual English subtask, 0.880 for the monolingual Hindi subtask, and 0.450 for the crosslingual subtask.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2701336.2701634", "authors": ["Johannes Leveling"], "references": ["O.

Parallelizing OPTICS is considered challenging as the algorithm exhibits a strongly sequential data access order. We present a scalable parallel OPTICS algorithm (Poptics) designed using graph algorithmic concepts. To break the data access sequentiality, POPTICS exploits the similarities between the OPTICS algorithm and Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm. Additionally, we use the disjoint-set data structure to achieve a high parallelism for distributed cluster extraction. Using high dimensional datasets containing up to a billion floating point numbers, we show scalable speedups of up to 27.5 for our OpenMP implementation on a 40-core shared-memory machine, and up to 3,008 for our MPI implementation on a 4,096-core distributed-memory machine. We also show that the quality of the results given by POPTICS is comparable to those given by the classical OPTICS algorithm.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2503210.2503255", "authors": ["Mostofa Ali Patwary\n,", "Diana Palsetia\n,", "Ankit Agrawal\n,", "Wei-keng Liao\n,", "Fredrik Manne\n,", "Alok Choudhary"], "references": ["Parallel K-means data clustering, 2005. http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/wkliao/Kmeans/.", "CLUTO - clustering high-dimensional datasets, 2006. http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/cluto/cluto/.", "Cliquemod, 2009. http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/steve/networks/cliquemod/.", "R.

Users are starting to adopt cloud model in data mining applications. However, due to the complexity of parallel/cloud computing, it is difficult for average users to express a parallel computing paradigm for their applications in cloud. In order to isolate users from the complexity of parallel/cloud programming, a middleware to enable high performance data mining, called DM-Midware, is proposed. It hides the details of MapReduce programming from users by automatically launching mappers through a set of user programming APIs. Directive-based parallelization scheme automatically \"translates\" a serial program into a SMP or Multi-core based parallel program. Heterogeneous computing resources can be invoked to conduct parallel execution by API-based scheme. A two-step scheduling scheme is proposed to maximize the throughput of the cloud system. We evaluate DM-Midware by executing a representative data mining algorithm in a private cloud. Experimental results demonstrate good scalability and adaptability.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.152", "authors": ["Guoyu Ou\n,", "Ying Liu\n,", "Xinyu Ma\n,", "Cheng Wang"], "references": ["M.J.

Both research and practice indicate that traditional universal DBMS architecture hardly satisfies new trends in data processing in such environment. NoSQL databases enable better application development productivity through a more flexible data model, greater ability to scale dynamically to support more users and data, an ability to develop highly responsive applications and more complex processing of data.\nOn the other hand, NoSQL databases support solving data problems only partially. We will describe their basic features like horizontal scalability and concurrency model, which offer mostly weaker tools for querying and transactions processing than relational SQL-like database systems do. We will also present some data models and querying capabilities of NoSQL databases in more detail as well as an overview of some their representatives.\nThe NoSQL system properties mentioned imply that most of them are unsuitable, e.g., for the DW and BI querying or, in general, for the enterprise data processing. Consequently, new database architectures and various hybrid solutions are developed.

Unlike approaches that rely on music content and have been researched for almost two decades, music-context-based (or contextual) approaches to music retrieval are a quite recent field of research within music information retrieval (MIR). Contextual data refers to all music-relevant information that is not included in the audio signal itself. In this article, we focus on contextual aspects of music primarily accessible through web technology. We discuss different sources of context-based data for individual music pieces and for music artists. We summarize various approaches for constructing similarity measures based on the collaborative or cultural knowledge incorporated into these data sources. In particular, we identify and review three main types of context-based similarity approaches: text-retrieval-based approaches (relying on web-texts, tags, or lyrics), co-occurrence-based approaches (relying on playlists, page counts, microblogs, or peer-to-peer-networks), and approaches based on user ratings or listening habits. This article elaborates the characteristics of the presented context-based measures and discusses their strengths as well as their weaknesses.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2542205.2542206", "authors": ["Peter Knees\n,", "Markus Schedl"], "references": ["Aizenberg, N., Koren, Y., and Somekh, O. 2012.

This enables a novel human-driven approach for service creation in a variety of domains (e.g., healthcare, transportation, etc.) Telecom operators own and manage billions of mobile network events (Call Detailed Records - CDRs) per day: interpreting such a big stream of data needs a deep understanding of the events' context through the available background knowledge. We introduce an ontological and stochastic model (HRBModel) to interpret mobile human behavior using merged mobile network data and the geo-referenced background knowledge (e.g., OpenStreetMap, etc.) The model characterizes locations with human activities that can happen (with a given likelihood) there. This allows us to predicatively compile sets of tasks that people are likely to engage in under certain contextual conditions or to characterize exceptional events detected from anomalies in the CDR.

With the exponential growth of applications' number, many works have been done to recommender the interesting applications for users. To check the effectiveness of these methods, the researchers are all tend to choose the traditional accuracy metrics to evaluate their system. However, considering the particularity of the mobile application recommendation, the accuracy evaluation metrics are not enough. Aiming at this problem, the goal of this paper is towards propose a new metric to evaluate the results of the mobile recommender systems and present an associated recommendation methodology. Base on the real usage pattern of mobile applications, we suggest a new evaluation metric called Cooperation. That is, when users use one application, they would enjoy using another one, we say those two applications have Cooperation Relation. In addition to, we also design and implement a strategy, which could improve the Cooperation degree of the mobile application recommendation results.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.142", "authors": ["Fei Wang\n,", "Zhe Zhang\n,", "Hailong Sun\n,", "Richong Zhang\n,", "Xudong Liu"], "references": ["P.

In order to link and integrate this data on the Web, it is of paramount importance to map relational data to the RDF data model and make Linked Data interfaces to the data available. We can distinguish two main approaches: First, the database can be transformed into RDF row by row and the resulting knowledge base can be exposed using a triple store. Second, an RDB2RDF mapper performs SPARQL-to-SQL rewriting and thus exposes a virtual RDF graph based on the relational database. The key challenge of such a SPARQL-to-SQL rewriting is to create a SQL query which can be efficiently executed by the optimizer of the underlying relational database. In this article we discuss and evaluate the impact of different optimizations on query execution time using SparqlMap, a R2RML compliant SPARQL-to-SQL rewriter and compare the performance with state-of-the-art systems.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2539150.2539247", "authors": ["Jörg Unbehauen\n,", "Claus Stadler\n,", "Sören Auer"], "references": ["C.

Privacy-preserving knowledge discovery, if done correctly, can alleviate this problem. One of the most important and widely used data mining techniques is that of classification. We consider the model where a single provider has centralized access to a dataset and would like to release a classifier while protecting privacy to the best extent possible. Recently, the model of differential privacy has been developed which provides a strong privacy guarantee even if adversaries hold arbitrary prior knowledge. In this paper, we apply this rigorous privacy model to develop a Naive Bayes classifier, which is often used as a baseline and consistently provides reasonable classification performance. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach, and discuss how it could be potentially deployed in PaaS clouds.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.80", "authors": ["Jaideep Vaidya\n,", "Basit Shafiq\n,", "Anirban Basu\n,", "Yuan Hong"], "references": ["J.

Thus, timely presenting proper advertisements to users will encourage them to click on search ads. Until now, how to efficiently improve the ad performance to earn more clicks remains a main task. In this paper, we focus on the scope of smart phone and produce a social intentional model with advertising based features to forecast future trend on ads' click-through rate (CTR). In terms of social intentional model, we analyze Chinese text content of technology forum to derive social intentional factors which are Hotness, Sentiment, Promotion, and Event. Our results indicate that with knowing public opinions or occurring events beforehand can efficiently enhance click prediction.

An Envy Free allocation may not exist in general and one can search for a minimal envy allocation. The search problem of minimizing envy for indivisible resource allocation is presented and a negotiation based transfer algorithm for solving it is proposed. The proposed algorithm performs a distributed any time local search for minimal envy solutions. The algorithm is composed of two phases. One phase performs hill climbing by the transfer of a single good among agents. The other phase of search uses elimination of open-end envy cycles, thereby utilizing the transfer of whole bundles. An extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm demonstrates the advantage of using the combined two phase algorithm.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.90", "authors": ["Arnon Netzer\n,", "Amnon Meisels"], "references": ["J.

Using the micro-blog as a way of spreading information more broadly has gained much interest as a new social medium where the contents can be delivered in real-time.

In this paper, we present a real time application that summarizes the posts by relevancy, considering the time that the posts are written. We set Hadoop environment with HBase since the application needs to be scalable and also, fault-tolerant.

A network administrator would want to select a combination of ports that would be most beneficial to the users and these ports would be treated as least vulnerable. However, this is not a trivial task and can be very time-consuming, O(n!), if brute force or other naïve approaches are used to select a given number of ports from 65,536 ports available. As genetic algorithms (GAs) are commonly used to obtain near-optimal solution for complex and time-consuming tasks, this paper proposes a GA for the selection of open ports for a web filter. The gene value for each port is based on the malicious issues associated with the port and the importance of the port to the client using the web filter. The proposed algorithm is implemented in Java, and the simulation results show that GA is very accurate in identifying open ports for a given web filter.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/s00779-012-0602-6", "authors": ["Sajid Hussain\n,", "Anjolaoluwa Olayemi\n,", "Sang-Soo Yeo"], "references": ["Goldberg D, Karp B, Ke Y, Nath S, Seshan S (1989) Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning.

The constraint density, or the ratio of the number of constraints to the number of variables, determines the difficulty of either finding a solution or minimizing the set of variable assignment conflicts in a constraint problem. Reducing the active density of a problem typically reduces difficulty in finding a solution. We present a fully distributed technique for reducing the active density of constraint graphs that represent Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP), called Virtual Structure Reduction (VSR). The VSR technique leverages the occurrence of frozen pairs, or variables that must be assigned the same value based on shared constraints between variables within the local neighborhood. We show how frozen pairs can be used to identify surrogate relationships between variables which reduces the active set of nodes in the constraint graph and leads to a reduction in active density. We discuss our DCOP solver, integrated with the Distributed Stochastic Algorithm (DSA), called VSR-DSA. The VSR-DSA algorithm demonstrates significant performance gains compared to the DSA-B and MGM algorithms in messages, cycles, solution quality, and time on randomized instances of the 3-coloring problem.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.89", "authors": ["Nathaniel Gemelli\n,", "Jeffrey Hudack\n,", "Jae C.

We have developed a generalized mean-field variational inference algorithm for the LapSSvMFs.

However, forum content quality varies from excellent to mediocre and spam; thus, search methods should find not only relevant threads but also those with high quality content. Some studies have shown that leveraging quality indicators improves thread search. However, these studies ignored the hierarchical and the conversational structures of threads in estimating topical relevance and content quality. In that regard, this paper introduces leveraging message quality indicators in ranking threads. To achieve this, we first use the Voting Model to convert message level quality features into thread level features. We then train a learning to rank method to combine these thread level features. Preliminary results with some features reveal that representing threads as collections of messages is superior to treating them as concatenations of their messages. The results show also the utility of leveraging message content quality as compared to non quality-based methods.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2537734.2537752", "authors": ["Ameer Tawfik Albaham\n,", "Naomie Salim"], "references": ["A.

As well as supporting information retrieval (IR), CLNSS has other applications in mining parallel and comparable data across different languages. In this paper, we present an overview of the work carried out for our participation in the Cross Language !ndian News Story Search (CL!NSS) task at FIRE 2013. In the CL!NSS task we explored the problem of cross language news search for the English-Hindi language pair. English news stories are used as queries to seek similar news documents from Hindi news articles. Hindi being a resource-scarce language offers many challenges towards retrieving relevant news articles. We investigate and contrast translation of input queries from English to Hindi using the Google and Bing translation services. To support translation of out-of-vocabulary words we use the Google transliteration service. A key challenge of the CL!NSS task is formation of search queries from the English news articles, since they are much longer than the much shorter queries typically used in IR applications. To address this problem, we explore the use of summarization to extract a query from the input news documents, and use these summarized queries as the input to the cross language IR system. We explore the use of query expansion using pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) in the IR process, since this has been shown to be effective for cross language IR in many previous investigations. We also explore in detail the use of data fusion techniques over different sets of retrieved results obtained using diverse query formulation techniques. For the CL!NSS task our team submitted 3 main runs. The results of our best run was ranked first among official submissions based on [email protected] and [email protected] values and second for [email protected] values. For the 25 test queries the results of our best main run were [email protected] 0.7400, [email protected] 0.6809 and [email protected] 0.7268. We present our methodology, official results and results of a number of post-task experiments that were conducted to further examine the cross language search problem. Our experiments reveal that query formulation plays a vital role in improving search results for news documents across different languages. Instead of using the complete news documents the summarized queries show better performance. Data fusion techniques also help to improve the performance of the system by boosting the rank of documents, thus improving the NDCG scores.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2701336.2701650", "authors": ["Piyush Arora\n,", "Jennifer Foster\n,", "Gareth J.

As existing resources are more and more constrained, novel means of utilising the data originating from these sensors are sought. Advanced IT infrastructures enable real-time processing use cases, such as travel time estimations along defined corridors. One major challenge is to deploy general purpose machine learning algorithms that are able to learn relationships between the covariates and a defined response variable. We introduce a data fusion approach using generalised additive models (GAM) to estimate journey times online in a real-time streaming platform. We experiments with bluetooth sensors and weather information to improve the estimation of journey times along a defined A3 corridor in south-central London. Our approach is able to continuously improve the journey time estimation as new (high-frequency) data becomes available. Our fusion platform also generalises to be able to process more data sources and it scales to city-wide deployments. This way, existing legacy sensor deployments can be utilised for novel value-added services and investments into infrastructural sensor deployments can be assessed in a data-driven way and on a needs basis.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2536714.2536722", "authors": ["Eric Bouillet\n,", "Bei Chen\n,", "Chris Cooper\n,", "Dominik Dahlem\n,", "Olivier Verscheure"], "references": ["Y.

The Lisp2 mark-compact collector is a classic but still widely-used compaction algorithm. It sequentially scans the entire heap to compact all live objects at one end of the heap while preserving their order of addresses. Since the heap is generally large, this scanning takes a long time. Although some collectors adopt a separate bitmap into which mark bits of objects are stored to reduce the scanning time, we observed that scanning the bitmap can take longer than scanning the heap if objects are densely located. We propose a new scanning method from this observation, which adaptively alternates methods of scanning depending on heap usage; it scans those parts of the heap where live objects are densely located whereas it scans the bitmap for the remaining parts. We implemented this scanning method in the Lisp2 collector of Jikes RVM.\nThe experimental results revealed that the adaptive scanner scanned faster than the method that only scanned the heap and the method that only scanned the bitmap.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2464157.2466480", "authors": ["Kazuya Morikawa\n,", "Tomoharu Ugawa\n,", "Hideya Iwasaki"], "references": ["D.

Annotating such large-scale data will cost huge amount of human resources and is thus unaffordable. Motivated by this challenging problem, we propose a novel sparse graph based multilabel propagation (SGMP) scheme for super large scale datasets. Both the efficacy and accuracy of the image annotation are further investigated under different graph construction strategies, where Gaussian noise and non-Gaussian sparse noise are simultaneously considered in the formulations of these strategies. Our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by focusing on: (1) For large-scale graph construction, a simple yet efficient LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)-based sparse graph construction scheme is proposed to speed up the construction. We perform the multilabel propagation on this hashing-based graph construction, which is derived with LSH approach followed by sparse graph construction within the individual hashing buckets; (2) To further improve the accuracy, we propose a novel sparsity induced scalable graph construction scheme, which is based on a general sparse optimization framework. Sparsity essentially implies a very strong prior: for large scale optimization, the values of most variables shall be zeros when the solution reaches the optimum. By utilizing this prior, the solutions of large-scale sparse optimization problems can be derived by solving a series of much smaller scale subproblems; (3) For multilabel propagation, different from the traditional algorithms that propagate over individual label independently, our proposed propagation first encodes the label information of an image as a unit label confidence vector and naturally imposes inter-label constraints and manipulates labels interactively. Then, the entire propagation problem is formulated on the concept of Kullback-Leibler divergence defined on probabilistic distributions, which guides the propagation of the supervision information. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset NUS-WIDE with 270k images and its lite version NUS-WIDE-LITE with 56k images well demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed multi-label propagation scheme.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2542205.2542209", "authors": ["Xiangyu Chen\n,", "Yadong Mu\n,", "Hairong Liu\n,", "Shuicheng Yan\n,", "Yong Rui\n,", "Tat-Seng Chua"], "references": ["Andoni, A. and Indyk, P. 2008.

Office documents are typical examples of XML documents. Besides, demands for searching documents become increasing and complicated since we need not only keyword search but also similarity search. In our previous work, we proposed LAX+, an algorithm for measuring a similarity value between XML trees. However, there is a problem that LAX+ performs a rigid matching at leaf-nodes of XML trees. In this paper, we propose two methods: KLAX and LAX&KEY. To measure a precise similarity value between leaf-nodes, KLAX improves LAX+ by-checking the number of common keywords in the leaf-nodes. LAX&KEY separately measures a similarity value between XML trees by LAX+ and a similarity value of common keywords in XML trees, and then combines them.

This paper proposed an ontology-based query expansion using a concept of the combination of an IR technique and association rule mining to examine and evaluate of an agricultural expert retrieval systems. An association rule mining is applied in the inference engine in order to optimize the user's queries. A set of inference rules are also created to support the expertise retrieval task. The result set is depends on the new query which expands from user's queries as keywords using an agricultural ontology structures. The experts who have expertise in topics or keywords, type of plants and problem solving are the elements of the ontology and will be used to search the relevant publications.

Such applications need to understand user preferences in order to provide customized services. As user engagement with web videos has grown significantly, understanding user preferences based on videos viewed looks promising. The above requires ability to classify web videos into a set of categories appropriate for the personalization application. However, such categories may be substantially different from common categories like Sports, Music, Comedy, etc. used by video sharing websites, leading to lack of labeled training videos for such categories. In this paper, we study the feasibility and effectiveness of a fully automated framework to obtain training videos to enable classification of web videos to any arbitrary set of categories, as desired by the personalization application. We investigate the desired properties in training data that can lead to high performance of the trained classification models.

Although widely studied in the literature, the concept is difficult to be analyzed in a systematic manner, due to 1) the abundance of factors that can be related to Shared SA, and 2) the lack of a commonly agreed, formal definition. This paper proposes Agent-Based Social Simulation as a scientific method to study questions related to Shared SA. Founded in theories from Social Science, an agent-based framework is presented, which allows users to explore a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an automated manner. The resulting global patterns are illustrated by discussing a number of simulation results for different parameter settings. These simulations show that, although preliminary, the presented framework has potential as an analytical tool for researchers and policy makers.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.110", "authors": ["Tibor Bosse\n,", "Kamil Majdanik\n,", "Kees Boersma\n,", "Katrín Ingibergsdóttir"], "references": ["Artman, H.

Pinterest, a pinboard-style image sharing social service, has attracted much attention recently and become one of the most popular social networks. The special mechanism and style of Pinterest distinguish it from other previous popular social networks and shape totally different user behaviors, which makes it worth launching a new study on Pinterest. In this paper, we have an empirical study of user behaviors on Pinterest, based on a large Pinterest dataset containing 1.13 million users, 57 million following relations, 19 million boards and 933 million pins. We focus on studying the characteristics, manifestations and overall effects of user behaviors from many aspects, including the user interests, correlations between neighboring users, the common features of the most popular users, the topology of the network structure, etc. The most distinguishing characteristic of Pinterest is that users focus on everyday lives and are willing to collect many images about decoration, food, fashion, etc, which makes Pinterest an ideal advertising and marketing platform for retail companies. Many other qualitative and quantitative analysis on user behaviors have been discussed in our paper. We provide a comprehensive understanding of user behaviors on the Pinterest social network, which is our main contribution.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.57", "authors": ["Ziming Feng\n,", "Feng Cong\n,", "Kailong Chen\n,", "Yong Yu"], "references": ["R.

SilverLine uses login information to associate a user with each Web session; it then taints each file and database record and applies information-flow tracking to the data associated with each session to ensure that application data is released only to sessions of authorized users. SilverLine focuses on isolating data between user sessions and is thus most suitable to applications that involve single user sessions (e.g., banking, e-commerce). We have implemented SilverLine on Linux; our implementation demonstrates that SilverLine can protect a PHP-based Web application from many of the most common server-side Web application attacks by modifying only about 60 lines of code from the original application. Our evaluation shows that SilverLine incurs a performance overhead of about 20-30% over unmodified applications.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2523649.2523663", "authors": ["Yogesh Mundada\n,", "Anirudh Ramachandran\n,", "Nick Feamster"], "references": ["Amazon Relational Database Service. http://aws.amazon.com/rds/.", "Attrition.net.

The connection among users, resources and these annotations, often called afolksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, and to obtain recommendations. Releasing these tagging datasets accelerates both commercial and research work on recommender systems. However, adversaries may re-identify a user and her/his sensitivity information from the tagging dataset using a little background information. Recently, several private techniques have been proposed to address the problem, but most of them lack a strict privacy notion, and can hardly resist the number of possible attacks. This paper proposes an private releasing algorithm to perturb users' profile in a strict privacy notion, differential privacy, with the goal of preserving a user's identity in a tagging dataset. The algorithm includes three privacy preserving operations: Private Tag Clustering is used to shrink the randomized domain and Private Tag Selection is then applied to find the most suitable replacement tags for the original tags. To hide the numbers of tags, the third operation, Weight Perturbation, finally adds Lap lace noise to the weight of tags We present extensive experimental results on two real world datasets, Delicious and Bibsonomy.

Recently, a lot of sentiment analysis models have been proposed, including supervised and unsupervised approaches. However, the role of supervised models has been undermined by the phenomenon of big data, and the unsupervised ones are drawing more and more attention. But, most current unsupervised methods are based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and they need to specify the number of aspects in advance, making them subjective. In addition, these methods treat factual words and opinioned words the same, and assume that one sentence contains only one aspect, all of which make the existing unsupervised methods unsatisfactory. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel hybrid Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (HDP-LDA) model. This model can automatically determine the number of aspects, distinguish factual words from opinioned words, and further effectively extracts the aspect specific sentiment words. Experiment result shows that our model can clearly capture the aspects people mentioned and the specific sentiment words they use in each aspect, improving the performance of sentiment analysis efficiently. At last, we compared our model with the influential topic models, namely, JST, AUSM and Maxine-LDA, on the online restaurant review, and found our model performs very well.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.47", "authors": ["Wanying Ding\n,", "Xiaoli Song\n,", "Lifan Guo\n,", "Zunyan Xiong\n,", "Xiaohua Hu"], "references": ["Carbonell, J., Subjective Understanding: Computer Models of Belief Systems.

One of the most useful information that can be extracted is the geographical one. This paper shows an approach to detect the geographical focus of Twitter users at city level based on the text of the tweets that users have sent and external information from Wikipedia. The main goal of this work is to show how important could be external formal text resources such as Wikipedia when it comes to resolve the geographical focus in short pieces of informal natural language text. In order to accomplish this objective, we have assessed our system with a language model system, comparing the results using only the informal pieces of text (tweets) and merging it with formal text coming from Wikipedia. In our experiments, we found that the aid of formal pieces of text, such as those obtained from the Wikipedia articles and links, could be useful when the existing amount of data is rather limited.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2533888.2533928", "authors": ["Fernando S.

It allows agents to learn local decision policies based on their local observations and rewards, and, meanwhile, coordinates agents' learning processes to ensure the global learning performance. One key question is that how coordination mechanisms impact learning algorithms so that agents' learning processes are guided and coordinated. This paper presents a new shaping approach that effectively integrates coordination mechanisms into local learning processes. This shaping approach uses two-level agent organization structures and combines reward shaping and action shaping. The higher-level agents dynamically and periodically produce the shaping heuristic knowledge based on the learning status of the lower-level agents. The lower-level agents then uses this knowledge to coordinate their local learning processes with other agents. Experimental results show our approach effectively speeds up the convergence of multi-agent learning in large systems.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.127", "authors": ["Xiangbin Zhu\n,", "Chongjie Zhang\n,", "Victor Lesser"], "references": ["J.

Driven by the aim to develop better training in coping skills, this paper presents an adaptive computational model of emotion regulation strategies, which is inspired by recent neurological literature. The model can be used both to gain more insight in emotion regulation training itself and to develop intelligent virtual reality-based training environments. The behaviour of the model is illustrated by a number of simulation experiments and by a mathematical analysis. In addition, a preliminary validation points out that it is able to approximate empirical data obtained from an experiment with human participants.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.116", "authors": ["Tibor Bosse\n,", "Charlotte Gerritsen\n,", "Jeroen de Man\n,", "Jan Treur"], "references": ["C.

Most existing works diversify suggestions by query log analysis, however, for structured data, not all query logs are available. To this end, this paper studies the problem of suggesting diverse query terms by using topics from Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a successful online encyclopedia, and has high coverage of entities and concepts. We first obtain all relevant topics from Wikipedia, and then map each term to these topics. As the mapping is a nontrivial task, we leverage information from both Wikipedia and structured data to semantically map each term to topics. Finally, we propose a fast algorithm to efficiently generate the suggestions. Extensive evaluations are conducted on a real dataset, and our approach yields promising results.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.21", "authors": ["Hao Hu\n,", "Mingxi Zhang\n,", "Zhenying He\n,", "Peng Wang\n,", "Wei Wang"], "references": ["P.-A.

Surveillance in hospitals holds the potential of reducing NI rates by more than thirty per cent but performing this task by hand is impossible at scale of every appointment, examination, intervention, and other event in healthcare. Narratives in patient records can indicate NIs and their automated processing could scale out surveillance. This paper describes a text summarisation system for NI surveillance and situational awareness in hospitals. The system is a cascaded sentence, report, and patient classifier. It generates three types of visual summaries for an input of patient narratives and ward maps: cross-sectional statuses at the same point of time, longitudinal trends in time, and highlighted text to see the textual evidence leading to a given status or trend. This gives evidence for and against a given NI in the levels of hospitals, wards, patients, reports, and sentences. The system has excellent recall and precision (e.g., 0.95 and 0.71 for reports) in summarisation for the subset of NIs from fungal species on 1,880 authentic records of 527 patients from 3 hospitals. To demonstrate the system design, we have developed a mobile iPad compatible web-application and a simulation with eighteen patients on three medical wards in one hospital during one month with 61 records in total. The design is extendable to other summarisation tasks.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2537734.2537739", "authors": ["Hanna Suominen\n,", "Leif Hanlen"], "references": ["B.

Because Poker is a game with hundreds of variants differing from each other by their betting structure, number of cards in the deck or winning conditions, numerous agents have been created for several different variants of the game. However, there is not a single unified description model that allows for those agents to be tested across different Poker variants inexpensively. For this reason, we introduce the Poker Game Description Language (PGDL), which, unlike other incomplete information GDL's, is uniquely focused on Poker agent development and testing. PGDL is integrated into a playable system which not only makes available a basic Agent Development API in Prolog, but also provides a simple in-built agent which can adapt to user-defined rules. In addition, this framework has a simple GUI which both basic and advanced test subjects demonstrated to be adequate and easy-to-use when defining new PGDL instances. We believe that despite the existence of more generic general game playing systems, the fact that our language natively supplies a shared infrastructure, common to all Poker variants, renders our approach very pertinent for Poker agent development. Tests demonstrated that our language was capable of describing the most popular Poker variants.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.131", "authors": ["João Castro Correia\n,", "Luís Filipe Teófilo\n,", "Henrique Lopes Cardoso\n,", "Luís Paulo Reis"], "references": ["D.

Accordingly, several studies have proposed metrics based on links to infer web page content quality. However, as far as we know, the only work that has examined the correlation between such metrics and content quality consisted of a limited study that left many open questions. In spite of these metrics having been shown successful in the task of ranking pages which were provided as answers to queries submitted to search engines, it is not possible to determine the specific contribution of factors such as quality, popularity, and importance to the results. This difficulty is partially due to the fact that such information is hard to obtain for Web pages in general. Unlike ordinary Web pages, the quality, importance and popularity of Wikipedia articles are evaluated by human experts or might be easily estimated. Thus, it is feasible to verify the relation between link analysis metrics and such factors in Wikipedia articles, our goal in this work. To accomplish that, we implemented several link analysis algorithms and compared their resulting rankings with the ones created by human evaluators regarding factors such as quality, popularity and importance. We found that the metrics are more correlated to quality and popularity than to importance, and the correlation is moderate.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2526188.2526198", "authors": ["Raíza Hanada\n,", "Marco Cristo\n,", "Maria da Graça Campos Pimentel"], "references": ["B.

Many Twitter users post their opinions, impressions, and statuses of televised events such as sports events.

We propose a method of generating live sports updates from Twitter posts on an event. Our method selects descriptive and prompt tweets that are posted within a short time after important sub events by exploiting users called good reporters, who promptly explain what is happening at each moment throughout the event.

It is widely used in current social media sites including Twitter and Google+, and serves as a significant meta tag to categorize users' messages, to propagate ideas and topic trends. The use of hash tags has become an integral part of the social media culture. However, the free-form nature and the varied contexts of hash tags bring challenges: how to understand hash tags and discover their relationships? In this paper, we propose Tag-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA), a new topic modeling approach to bridge hash tags and topics. TLDA extends Latent Dirichlet Allocation by incorporating the observed hash tags in the generative process. In TLDA, a hash tag is mapped into the form of a mixture of shared topics. This representation further enables the analysis of the relationships between the hash tags. Applying our model to tweet data, we first illustrate the ability of our approach to explain hard-to-understand hash tags with topics. We also demonstrate that our approach enables users to further analyze the relationships between the hash tags.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.38", "authors": ["Zhiqiang Ma\n,", "Wenwen Dou\n,", "Xiaoyu Wang\n,", "Srinivas Akella"], "references": ["H.

While shortest path distance problem has been investigated extensively, massive graphs on social networks such as Facebook and Linked In call for reinvestigation of the problem due to the requirements of scalability and suitability for distributed computing. We propose a core-net based approach to address the problem. In our new core-net algorithm, popular nodes are selected based on their node degrees. Since some of these popular nodes may not be connected, we further include bridge nodes, which connect two or more popular nodes and improve their connectivity, but are not popular nodes themselves. Breadth First Search (BFS) technique is then used to compute shortest paths between any pair of nodes on the core net. When the shortest path between two arbitrary vertices, u and v, is queried, we approximate it with triangulation. We present a graph calculus theory in which the estimated distance goes to the real shortest distance when the degree threshold goes to zero. Analysis and simulation results confirm the superiority of our design, which can easily scale to MapReduce.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.59", "authors": ["Lixin Fu\n,", "Jing Deng"], "references": ["Dijkstra, E.W., A note on two problems in connexion with graphs.

For distributed systems, locality means the operations take place in local computing nodes without the communication with remote computing nodes. In this paper we present LI-MR (Local Iteration MapReduce) framework to improve a class of graph operators which can be described by repeated matrix-vector multiplications. LI-MR considers locality of sub graphs and adopts coarse granularity of communication unit for MapReduce. In particular, for sub graphs, only partial operations need synchronization. We propose a method to implement random data access on Hadoop by outputting the results to HBase. With the support of range query provided by HBase, LI-MR allows sub graphs to fulfil computation task with enough information in main memory. Because the locality feature of sub graphs, the info for the computation is limited. In this way, LI-MR framework combines in-memory computation with MapReduce model for graph algorithms.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.7", "authors": ["Qiuhong Li\n,", "Ke Dai\n,", "Wei Wang\n,", "Peng Wang\n,", "Rongming He\n,", "Mingxiu Dong"], "references": ["http://hadoop.apache.org/.", "http://mahout.apache.org/.", "B.

For news geo-localization, an Ordinal Correlation Consistent Matrix Factorization (OCCMF) model is proposed to maintain the relevance rankings of locations to a specific news document and simultaneously capture intra-relations among locations and documents. To visualize news, we develop a novel method to enrich news documents with appropriate web images. Specifically, multiple queries are first generated from news documents for image search, and then the appropriate images are selected from the collected web images by an intelligent fusion approach based on multiple features. Obtaining the geo-localized and image enriched news resources, we further employ a joint ranking strategy to provide relevant, timely and popular news items as the answer of user searching queries.

Senser does not rely on a PKI and operates even when SSL/TLS is not supported by the web server. Senser operates as a network of proxies located at different vantage points on the Internet. Clients query a random subset of Senser proxies for compact descriptions of a desired web page, and apply consensus and matching algorithms to the returned results to locally render a \"majority\" web page. To ensure diverse selections of proxies (and consequently decrease an adversary's ability to manipulate a majority of the proxies' requests), Senser leverages Internet mapping systems that accurately predict AS-level paths between available proxies and the desired web page. We demonstrate using a deployment of Senser on Amazon EC2 that Senser detects and mitigates attempts by adversaries to manipulate web content --- even when controlling large collections of autonomous systems --- while maintaining reasonable performance overheads.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2523649.2523669", "authors": ["Jordan Wilberding\n,", "Andrew Yates\n,", "Micah Sherr\n,", "Wenchao Zhou"], "references": ["R.

In many cases, these information networks contain objects connected by multiple links and described by different attributes. In this paper the problem of clustering homogeneous information networks in groups with similar attributes and connections is studied. Clustering such networks is a challenging task due to different importance of links and attributes. In addition, it is not straightforward how to balance the links and attributes information. In this article we describe these challenges and propose a fuzzy clustering model as well as a fuzzy clustering algorithm, HASCOP. Extensive experimentation on real world datasets has shown that HASCOP can be successfully applied in such networks, demonstrating its efficacy and superiority against the state-of-the-art attributed graph clustering methods.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.49", "authors": ["Andreas Papadopoulos\n,", "George Pallis\n,", "Marios D.

The techniques solve the problem of language labeling, by identifying query word as English or Hindi (E or H) term in mixed language sentence queries. Manual and machine learning algorithms are used. For the transliteration of H labeled word we use manual (dictionary based), generative (grapheme based) and combination of both in different algorithms. We observe that learning based classification improves labeling accuracy. Extraction based transliteration gives better result than Generation based when the terms are available in bilingual dictionary. But it may lead to incorrect transliteration if terms are wrongly aligned and the approach fails for out-of-dictionary words. In this case transliteration by generation is the only alternative. But generation alone does not perform well because of spelling variation in transliterated terms. During evaluation we also observe that transliteration systems are generally corpus-biased. Although our performance in the official submission was moderate, we obtain better results during our post-submission experiments.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2701336.2701649", "authors": ["Dinesh Kumar Prabhakar\n,", "Sukomal Pal"], "references": ["Chinnakotla, M.

Hence, EV charging needs to be coordinated appropriately. Prior work addressing this challenge focused on static charging strategies responding to exogenous price vectors. We extend this work in two directions: To achieve an endogenous resource pricing, we substitute exogenous pricing for a local market platform which allocates available charging capacity to demand from EVs. To achieve meaningful interaction with this market, we model the bidding behavior of EVs by means of a Q-learning approach. Using an integrated trip-based state space representation spanned by required battery level and time to departure, we moderate between bidding aggressiveness and mobility requirements. For appropriate learning parameters, bidding behavior converges and the market achieves significant load shifting.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.97", "authors": ["David Dauer\n,", "Christoph M.

Whilst various media generation and management systems exist it still remains a challenge to discover the \"right\" metadata information for the right purpose. This paper describes an approach to extract relevant geospatial information through reverse geocoding in addition to cross-referencing several public geospatial data sources. The extracted geospatial information can be used to enable enrichment of media with rich semantic geo-metadata and therefore enable improved organisation and searching of the media. Central to the system is the cross-referencing and data fusion of several public geospatial datasets to determine the most relevant Points of Interest and extract their relevant features. These relevant Points of Interest and features are subsequently used to annotate media with human readable information, leading to enriched media repositories. The system has been implemented as a client/server architecture, with a web interface for the client front end and Java for the backend server side processing. Details of the implementation are discussed. Testing in a scenario has been undertaken and a discussion of the testing technique and results is presented. The initial results show the system to be effective at fusing several public geospatial datasets and extracting relevant geo-metadata.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2536853.2536888", "authors": ["Andrew Ennis\n,", "Liming Chen\n,", "Chris Nugent\n,", "George Ioannidis\n,", "Alexandru Stan"], "references": ["Ofcom, \"UK Communications 2013 - Fast facts,\" 2013. {Online}.

We introduce the idea of similarity, which has been widely studied in the filed of information retrieval, and incorporate multiple feature similarities into the FM framework, including content-based and context-based similarities. The similarity information not only captures the similar patterns from the referred objects, but enhances the convergence speed and accuracy of FM. In addition, in order to avoid the noise within large similarity of features, we also adopt the grouping FM as an extended method to model the problem. In our experiments, a music-recommendation dataset is used to assess the performance of the proposed approach. The datasets is collected from an online blogging website, which includes user listening history, user profiles, social information, and music information. Our experimental results show that, with various types of feature similarities the performance of music recommendation can be enhanced significantly. Furthermore, via the grouping technique, the performance can be improved significantly in terms of Mean Average Precision, compared to the traditional collaborative filtering approach.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.10", "authors": ["Chih-Ming Chen\n,", "Ming-Feng Tsai\n,", "Jen-Yu Liu\n,", "Yi-Hsuan Yang"], "references": ["Y.-H.

The problem of document annotation is addressed in the literature under two broad classes of techniques namely, key phrase extraction and key phrase abstraction. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate summary phrases for research documents. Given the dynamic nature of scientific research, it has become important to incorporate new and popular scientific terminologies in document annotations. For this purpose, we have used crowd-source knowledge bases like Wikipedia and WikiCFP (a open source information source for call for papers) for automating key phrase generation. Also, we have taken into account the lack of availability of the document's content (due to protective policies) and developed a global context based key-phrase identification approach. We show that given only the title of a document, the proposed approach generates its global context information using academic search engines like Google Scholar. We evaluated the performance of the proposed approach on real-world dataset obtained from a computer science research document corpus.

Existing trajectory anonymization techniques disregard the importance of time or the sensitivity of events. This article is the first, to our knowledge, thorough study on time-stamped event sequence anonymization. We propose a novel and tunable generalization framework tailored to event sequences. We generalize time stamps using time intervals and events using a taxonomy which models the domain semantics. We consider two scenarios: (i) sharing the data with a single receiver (the SSR setting), where the receiver’s background knowledge is confined to a set of time stamps and time generalization suffices, and (ii) sharing the data with colluding receivers (the SCR setting), where time generalization should be combined with event generalization. For both cases, we propose appropriate anonymization methods that prevent both user identification and event prediction. To achieve computational efficiency and scalability, we propose optimization techniques for both cases using a utility-based index, compact summaries, fast to compute bounds for utility, and a novel taxonomy-aware distance function. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach compared with state of the art, in terms of information loss, range query distortion, and preserving temporal causality patterns. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate efficiency and scalability on large-scale real and synthetic datasets.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2532643", "authors": ["Reza Sherkat\n,", "Jing Li\n,", "Nikos Mamoulis"], "references": ["Abul, O., Bonchi, F., and Nanni, M. 2008.

In this research we develop algorithms for mining user interests by integrating time decay mechanisms into topic-based user interest profiling.

Existing methods of microblogging recommendation have low personalization for the reason of focusing on the whole microblogging social network. On microblogging site, different users have different active degree, and different users have considerable variability in structures of followees or followers. It is therefore most necessary to understand microblogging from an individual user's perspective. In this paper, we propose a novel model of microblogging recommendation based on ego networks, called EgoRec, which has the ability of capturing personal interests more accurately. Specifically, the key idea of EgoRec is to make recommendation by homophily of ego networks. We take egos as target users being recommended, while alters as source users for recommendation. Homophily between individual users can be measured by ego profile factors and ego-alter social relations. We define three main social relations in ego networks: support relation, affinity relation and focal relation for recommendation. Moreover, by detecting latent factor and combining with the homophily factors in ego networks, it makes EgoRec more personalized. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the EgoRec model.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.25", "authors": ["Jing Sun\n,", "Yangyong Zhu"], "references": ["A.

This approach features peer-to-peer networks with the support of mobile devices that allows users to participate in social computing services including data sharing and searching services. Due to the limitations of system resource and network connectivity, mobile peers cannot easily undertake complicated operations, such as processing complex queries, indexing and transmitting large amount of data. This approach employs a super peer peer-to-peer network to deal with the problem of peer heterogeneity. It uses workstations as peers to assist mobile peers with insufficient storage, bandwidth and processing capability in dealing with complicated operations, while mobile peers possess ordinary operations such as publishing and searching data.

This article investigates the performance of virtual memory management of Virtual Machines (VMs) with a large virtual address space in 64-bit OSs, which imposes different pressure on memory virtualization than 32-bit systems. Each of the two conventional memory virtualization approaches, Shadowing Paging (SP) and Hardware-Assisted Paging (HAP), causes different overhead for different applications. Our experiments show that 64-bit applications prefer to run in a VM using SP, while 32-bit applications do not have a uniform preference between SP and HAP. In this article, we trace this inconsistency between 32-bit applications and 64-bit applications to its root cause through a systematic empirical study in Linux systems and discover that the major overhead of SP results from memory management in the 32-bit GNU C library (glibc). We propose enhancements to the existing memory management algorithms, which substantially reduce the overhead of SP. Based on the evaluations using SPEC CPU2006, Parsec 2.1, and cloud benchmarks, our results show that SP, with the improved memory allocators, can compete with HAP in almost all cases, in both 64-bit and 32-bit systems.

These sources are often ad-hoc, location-specific and only useful for users over short periods of time, or relate to tacit knowledge of users or crowds. The solution presented in this paper introduces an integrated concept of \"location\" and \"presence\" across the physical and virtual worlds enabling ad-hoc socializing of users looking for similar information. While the definition of presence in the physical world is straightforward their definitions in the virtual world are neither obvious nor trivial. We provide an integrated spatial model spanning both worlds which enables us to define presence of users in a unified way. This integrated model allows us to enable ad-hoc socializing of users browsing the Web with users in the physical world specific to their joint information needs and allows us to unlock the untapped information sources mentioned above. We describe our proof-of-concept implementation and provide an empirical analysis based on real-world experiments.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.6", "authors": ["Christian von der Weth\n,", "Manfred Hauswirth"], "references": ["Adar, E., Teevan, J., and Dumais, S.

Some of the arguments are surprising in themselves and shed a light on how we think, and how we have to change our thinking to at least grasp a bit of what is going to happen. Surprisingly, it also turns out that some reasons show the weaknesses of our information age and how knowing this, we can become better in handling complicated situations and negotiations.

Most previous applications use simple syntactic matching approaches on the class labels and/or comments, or expand the keyword query by using lexicons such as Word Net, but fail to retrieve relevant resources in many scenarios. Instead of relying on external sources, we investigate this problem by using the annotations of instances associated with classes in the knowledge base. We propose a general framework of this approach, which consists of two phases: the keyword query is first used to locate relevant instances, then we induce the classes given this list of weighted matched instances. If we identify sufficient text for the instances, then the first phase can be solved by a traditional information retrieval (IR) query, however the second phase might be cast in different ways: as an additive value function, as an IR problem with instance as queries, or as an instance-based ontology alignment problem. With many applicable strategies initiated from different viewpoints, we find that some of them are mathematically equivalent or very similar. In the experiments we compare our proposed framework to simple syntactic approaches and evaluate different strategies.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.19", "authors": ["Xingjian Zhang\n,", "Jeff Heflin"], "references": ["G.

On the other hand, a number of online service providers utilizing such data have emerged and improved effectiveness of smart grid technologies (for instance, demand-response aggregators), and therefore sharing of data is getting popular. In this work, we propose a customer-centric framework to manage, store, and share energy usage data in a privacy-enhanced way.

Self-organization has been proposed to be one of the solutions due to its autonomous capability to govern itself and to adapt upon changes. Developing self-organizing systems requires a suitable modeling method because of its unique characteristics, such as self-adaptive, decentralized, and emergent. Existing multiagent systems engineering methodologies lack modeling methods to design behavior adaptation for self-organizing systems. This paper proposes a role modeling method that allows designers to model how agents perform behavior adaptation at runtime by making transitions from one set of roles to another in decentralized manner. The behavior adaptation of each individual agent may eventually emerge as the adaptation of the organization. The proposed modeling method also helps designers to analyze issues that may occur because of playing multiple roles, such as role conflict, role overload, role transition oscillation, and other common issues in concurrency.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.122", "authors": ["Kemas M.

The commercial providers of these services spend large amounts of money measuring their own effectiveness and benchmarking against their competitors; nothing less than their corporate survival is at stake. Techniques for offline or \"batch\" evaluation of search quality have received considerable attention, spanning ways of constructing relevance judgments; ways of using them to generate numeric scores; and ways of inferring system \"superiority\" from sets of such scores.\nOur purpose in this paper is consider these mechanisms as a chain of inter-dependent activities, in order to explore some of the ramifications of alternative components. By disaggregating the different activities, and asking what the ultimate objective of the measurement process is, we provide new insights into evaluation approaches, and are able to suggest new combinations that might prove fruitful avenues for exploration. Our observations are examined with reference to data collected from a user study covering 34 users undertaking a total of six search tasks each, using two systems of markedly different quality.\nWe hope to encourage broader awareness of the many factors that go into an evaluation of search effectiveness, and of the implications of these choices, and encourage researchers to carefully report all aspects of the evaluation process when describing their system performance experiments.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2537734.2537745", "authors": ["Falk Scholer\n,", "Alistair Moffat\n,", "Paul Thomas"], "references": ["A.

Early web crawlers collected statistics about the web. In addition to collecting statistics about the web and indexing the applications for search engines, modern crawlers can be used to perform accessibility and vulnerability checks on the application.\nQuick expansion of the web, and the complexity added to web applications have made the process of crawling a very challenging one. Throughout the history of web crawling many researchers and industrial groups addressed different issues and challenges that web crawlers face. Different solutions have been proposed to reduce the time and cost of crawling. Performing an exhaustive crawl is a challenging question. Additionally, capturing the model of a modern web application and extracting data from it automatically is another open question.\nWhat follows is a brief history of different techniques and algorithms used from the early days of crawling up to the recent days.

The query independent relevance which is also known as the popularity or significance of a page is a valuable aspect of generic Web search ranking. But the research progression or the formalization of query independent significance for geospatial Web search has been limited to the basic adaption of general popularity of pages. In this paper, we discuss how several location sensitive properties could alter the significance of geospatial Web pages. We particularly argue the significance of pages with respect to categorical, regional, and granular criterions. We analyze these criterions over a huge geospatial Web graph of different German cities, and perform some small-scale evaluations of our approach. We derive some valuable heuristics on the link structure of geospatial Web that can be used in the ranking formulation, or to cater certain contextual information needs from end-user of a geospatial Web search system.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2533888.2533932", "authors": ["Chandan Kumar\n,", "Susanne Boll"], "references": ["D.

The main characteristic of this theory is the description of complex behavior exclusively in terms of stimulation and behavioral responses. That is to say, in terms of observable and controllable environmental events, instead of the internal mental mechanisms typically found in other approaches to psychology. In this way, not only trivial reflexive actions, but also a number of sophisticated phenomena can be effectively modeled, such as learning and emotional states. Our work, which we call the Behaviorist Agent Architecture, provides a computational framework with which to build agents according to these principles. It accounts for five aspects of agent behavior in an integrated manner: (i) stimulus conditioning, (ii) reflexes, (iii) operant behavior, (iv) drives, and (v) emotions. The objective of this text and of the architecture itself is to show that a consistent and coherent behaviorist point of view may be useful, despite its current lack of popularity.

The click path data originates from over seven million goal-oriented clicks gathered from the Wiki Game, an online game in which the goal is to find a path between two given random Wikipedia articles.

A comparison with centrality measures from literature is provided, showing that users generally \"know\" only a relatively small portion of the network, which they employ frequently in finding their goal, and that this set of nodes differs significantly from the set of central nodes according to various centrality measures. Next, using the notion of sub graph centrality, we show that users are able to identify a small yet efficient portion of the graph that is useful for successfully completing their navigation goals.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.41", "authors": ["Frank W.

The emerging paradigm of subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM), which has been evaluated through academic research and is increasingly deployed in commercial applications, has the potential to augment multi-agent system (MAS) models with a process-centric layer that preserves autonomy and concurrent interaction of agents as essential system characteristics. In this paper we provide an aligned meta-model and illustrate its operational benefits with examples from business process applications.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.102", "authors": ["Albert Fleischmann\n,", "Udo Kannengiesser\n,", "Werner Schmidt\n,", "Christian Stary"], "references": ["N.R.

The annotation method aims at annotating a text document in order to decrease the amount of comparing operations and increase the accuracy in the retrieval tasks. To accomplish this purpose, the kernel phrase concept is proposed to transform the groups of synonymy phrases into an only phrase which has the same meaning to the synonymy phrases. The transforming from a phrase to its kernel phrase is based on an ontology of Vietnamese words according to a different language model. This paper is focused on the annotation method using ontology to identify kernel phrases in a document. Some problems of Vietnamese language related to the annotation method are also presented.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2539150.2539234", "authors": ["Tuyen Thi-Thanh Do"], "references": ["Cao Xuân Hạo. 2007.

In this paper, we focus on a relevant but novel issue - how SNS search varies in developed and developing regions of the world and why. Analyzing 880 status messages collected from a widely used SNS, we have observed that, unavailability and inadequacy of information on web in developing countries play a significant role to motivate users using SNS for information retrieval.

These are important for our daily life because we use their applications anywhere and anytime. With the variety of applications available on these devices, however, it becomes more difficult to choose an appropriate application. Therefore we need a mechanism that recommends us suitable applications, which should depend on a user's context because he/she uses his/her devices differently in every context. This paper shows that it follows a power law what applications a user executes in daily life, and proposes a novel approach to find context-aware applications in the mobile devices. This approach is based on the term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), which is used for extracting important keywords in a document. Moreover, we propose an application recommendation mechanism using this approach. Experimental results show that this recommendation mechanism is more effective than the mechanism using Naive Bayes.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.69", "authors": ["Satoshi Kurihara\n,", "Koichi Moriyama\n,", "Masayuki Numao"], "references": ["Sunehag P., \"Using two-stage conditional word frequency models to model word burstiness and motivating TF-IDF\", Proc. of 11th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pp. 540-547, 2007.", "Hu, W., Xiao, X.

The former refers to features derived from the audio signal; the second refers to aspects of the music or artist not encoded in the audio, nevertheless important to human music perception; the third refers to contextual aspects of the user which change dynamically.\nIn this paper, we briefly review the well-researched categories of music content and music context features, before focusing on user-centric models, which have been neglected for a long time in music retrieval and recommendation approaches. In particular, we address the following tasks: (i) geospatial music recommendation from microblog data, (ii) user-aware music playlist generation on smart phones, and (iii) matching places of interest and music.\nThe approaches presented for task (i) rely on large-scale data inferred from microblogs, motivated by the fact that social media represent an unprecedented source of information about every topic of our daily lives. Information about music items and artists is thus found in abundance in user-generated data. The questions of how to infer information relevant to music recommendation from microblogs and what to learn from them are discussed. So are different ways of incorporating this kind of information into state-of-the-art music recommendation algorithms. The presented approaches targeted at tasks (ii) and (iii) model the user in a more comprehensive way than just using information about her location and music listening habits. We report results of a user study aiming at investigating the relationship between music listening activity and a large set of contextual user features. Based on these, an intelligent mobile music player that automatically adapts the current playlist to the user context is presented.\nEventually, we discuss different methods to solve task (iii), i.e., to determine music that suits a given place of interest, for instance, a major monument. In particular, we look into knowledge-based and tag-based methods to match music and places.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2536853.2536856", "authors": ["Markus Schedl"], "references": ["J.

Content in noise blocks will seriously harm information extraction, web mining, we searching, etc. Identifying the main content block is a key issue. In this paper, we propose a new low-cost vision based web page segmentation and informative block detection algorithm. Then we apply this algorithm to develop a bids update detection system for a local bids collecting company. Our algorithm mainly utilizes the position information of HTML element, which lowers the cost of applying multiple rules in VIPS. Our proposed row-column splitting indicator helps us provide an easy-to-use partition granularity value which solves the difficulty of choosing an appropriate Degree of Coherence (DoC) value in VIPS algorithm. This row-column splitting indicator also avoids the traditional high cost clustering process in detecting informative block. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that our proposed algorithm has a comparable performance compared to the VIPS and other informative block detection algorithms, but with ease of use granularity value and lower computation cost.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.194", "authors": ["Xuhong Zhang\n,", "Yanqing Zhang\n,", "Jing (Selena) He\n,", "Frank Cobia"], "references": ["D.

To facilitate searching of images about a particular geo entity we have developed a system that presents a unified view of images extracted from different data sources.

Scaling up content-based pub/sub to very large numbers of subscriptions is challenging: users are interested in low latency, that is, getting subscription results fast, while the pub/sub system provider is mostly interested in scaling, i.e., being able to serve large numbers of subscribers, with low computational resources utilization.\nWe present a novel approach for scalable content-based pub/sub in the presence of constraints on the available CPU and network resources, implemented within our pub/sub system Delta. We achieve scalability by off-loading some subscriptions from the pub/sub server, and leveraging view-based query rewriting to feed these subscriptions from the data accumulated in others. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm for organizing views in a multi-level dissemination network, exploiting view-based rewriting and powerful linear programming capabilities to scale to many views, respect capacity constraints, and minimize latency. The efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm are confirmed through extensive experiments and a large deployment in a WAN.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/2732240.2732241", "authors": ["Konstantinos Karanasos\n,", "Asterios Katsifodimos\n,", "Ioana Manolescu"], "references": ["N.

However, it is challenging to extract useful information from web forums accurately and efficiently. First, several page types exist in web forums and content is presented in different formats in these pages. Second, the content on the forum pages is stored in the form of data blocks. For the information to be meaningful, it is necessary to extract the relevant data blocks separately. The main problem with generic content extraction systems is that they cannot distinguish among various pages nor extract information with the required granularity. Although, several content extraction methods exist for web forums, these methods either do not satisfy the above requirements or use heuristics based approaches (such as assumptions on standard visual appearances, etc., resulting in limited applicability to different varieties of forum). In this paper, we propose a general and efficient content extraction method using the properties of links present in forum pages.

This paper investigates the potential of semantic technologies to address these questions. It introduces the NOAA Media Watch and presents a detailed case study how the metrics and visualizations of the webLyzard Web intelligence platform are used to track information flows across online media channels.

In case of navigational blocks, the block type determines the functionality of the hyperlinks it contains. For example, the hyperlinks in the main menu block represent the main topics of a site while the hyperlinks in a breadcrumb trail show the location in the content hierarchy. Hence, mining navigational blocks of specific types can provide valuable input for applications in the fields of crawling, ranking or presenting search results. However, analyzing visual features in order to identify specific navigational blocks as humans do is a difficult, resource-consuming task and a general solution does not exist yet. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem and present the Graph-based block extraction method (GRABEX) that can be adapted to classify different types of navigational blocks. The fundamental concept is that a separate graph-based link-analysis is conducted for groups of blocks. Each block group consists of blocks from different pages that have similar CSS class attributes. This allows discovering navigational blocks of specific types, e.g. breadcrumb trails, without analyzing any presentational features. We apply our method to mine breadcrumb trails and are the first to describe an applicable solution to this problem. In an extensive evaluation including 700 different sites, the GRABEX-method performed with perfect precision and high recall.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.42", "authors": ["Matthias Keller\n,", "Hannes Hartenstein"], "references": ["L.

The paper proposes a novel approach of generating online adaptive response in assisting search-and-rescue operations using situation awareness built from real-time heterogeneous spatio-temporal data streams. Online adaptive response is achieved by using agent-based cooperative task sharing and modeling agent decision making as self-organized emergent behavior based on concepts of complex adaptive system. An implemented simulation platform use concepts of situation modeling, domain task network, contract net protocol based negotiation and complex adaptive system to generate adaptive plans. Preliminary simulation results are promising as we have been able to demonstrate a repertoire of self-organized emergent behaviors.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.63", "authors": ["Sumant Mukherjee\n,", "Santunu Chaudhury"], "references": ["Rapid Detection of Rare Geospatial Events: Earthquake Warning Applications, Michael Olson, Annie Liu, Matthew Faulkner, K.

In this paper, we propose assisting users in database exploration by recommending to them additional items, called Ymal (\"You May Also Like\") results, that, although not part of the result of their original query, appear to be highly related to it. Such items are computed based on the most interesting sets of attribute values, called faSets, that appear in the result of the original query. The interestingness of a faSet is defined based on its frequency in the query result and in the database. Database frequency estimations rely on a novel approach of maintaining a set of representative rare faSets.

On the other side, niche blogs with a very specific topic only attract a small audience and thus have only a small reach. This results in a low ranking from today's blog retrieval systems. We argue that the consistency of a blog, i.e. how focused an author reports on a single topic, is a sign for expert knowledge. To find these blogs is particular important for other domain experts to identify blogs that they would like to follow and stay in active contact. To ease the retrieval of expert blogs, i.e. to separate them from the mass of blogs that report on random topics, we introduce a metric for blogs based on topic consistency. We divide the consistency ranking in four different aspects: (1) intra-post, (2) inter-post, (3) intra-blog, and (4) inter-blog consistency. By evaluating the metric with a test data set of 12,000 crawled blogs, we demonstrate the plausibility of our approach.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.37", "authors": ["Philipp Berger\n,", "Patrick Hennig\n,", "Christoph Meinel"], "references": ["H.

An important decision when developing a software agent is the choice of its internal architecture. Several models of deliberative and reactive architectures have already been proposed. However, approaches of hybrid software architectures that combine deliberative and reactive components, with the advantages of both behaviors, are still an open research topic. This work aims at contributing to the development of complex systems through the proposal of ontology-driven hybrid software agent architecture, by exploring automated reasoning and learning techniques. The architecture is composed of a reactive system and a deliberative one. Through a learning mechanism, the set of inference rules in the ontology of the deliberative system are transformed into reactive rules to be used by the reactive system, thus providing a more effective decision.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.172", "authors": ["Adriana Leite\n,", "Rosario Girardi\n,", "Paulo Novais"], "references": ["A.

While numerous models of search have been proposed, they have been largely conceptual in nature providing a descriptive account of the search process. For example, Bates' Berry Picking metaphor aptly describes how information seekers forage for relevant information [4]. However it lacks any predictive or explanatory power. In this talk, I will outline how microeconomic theory can be applied to interactive information retrieval, where the search process can be viewed as a combination of inputs (i.e. queries and assessments) which are used to \"produce\" output (i.e. relevance). Under this view, it is possible to build models that not only describe the relationship between interaction, cost and gain, but also explain and predict behaviour. During the talk, I will run through a number of examples of how economics can explain different behaviours. For example, why PhD students should search more than their supervisors (using an economic model developed by Cooper [6]), why queries are short [1], why Boolean searchers need to explore more results, and why it is okay to look at the first few results when searching the web [2]. I shall then describe how the cost of different interactions affect search behaviour [3], before extending the current theory to include other variables (such as the time spent on the search result page, the interaction with snippets, etc) to create more sophisticated and realistic models. Essentially, I will argue that by using such models we can:\n1. theorise and predict how users will behave when interacting with systems,\n2. ascertain how the costs of different interaction will influence search behaviour,\n3. understand why particular interaction styles, strategies, techniques are or are not adopted by users, and,\n4. determine what interactions and functionalities are worthwhile based on their expected gain and associated costs.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2537734.2537735", "authors": ["Leif Azzopardi"], "references": ["L.

The automation is transparent to the user and does not require any modification of how non-sensitive content is accessed. For sensitive content, a Fresh Browser Instance (FBI) is automatically created to access the content. Our prototype system Auto-FBI can provide support for novice users with predefined sensitive content sites as well as for more experienced users who can define conflict of interest (COI) classes which allows content from sites in the same user-defined class to coexist in a browser instance. Our initial performance evaluation of Auto-FBI shows that the overhead introduced by the approach is acceptable (less than 160 ms for sites that already have fast load time, but for slow sites the overhead can be as high as 750 ms).", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2523649.2523683", "authors": ["Mohsen Zohrevandi\n,", "Rida A.

In this paper, we present MoveSafe, a generic and extensible framework for transportation mode-based dynamic partitioning of a population for targeted alerting and for better transport management in hazard occurrence scenarios. We infer the transportation mode of the users dynamically using their location traces through continuous feature extraction and maintenance. In combination with the hazard location, we use the transportation mode information to find clusters of people at potentially different levels of risk and with different information needs. The framework also supports a variety of classification features, classifiers, clustering dimensions, and clustering algorithms.

Even though they constitute a significant portion of the energy market, not much has been achieved towards eliminating the inability for energy suppliers to perform long-term portfolio management, thus maximizing their revenue. The root cause of these problems is the difficulty in modeling consumers' behavior, based on their everyday activities and personal comfort. If one were able to provide targeted incentives based on consumer profiles, the expected impact and market benefits would be significant. This paper introduces a formal residential consumer modeling methodology, that allows (i) the decomposition of the observed electrical load curves into consumer activities and, (ii) the evaluation of the impact of behavioral changes on the household's aggregate load curve. Analyzing electrical consumption measurements from DEHEMS research project enabled the model extraction of real-life consumers. Experiments indicate that the proposed methodology produces accurate small-scale consumer models and verify that small shifts in appliance usage times are sufficient to achieve significant peak power reduction.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.96", "authors": ["Antonios Chrysopoulos\n,", "Christos Diou\n,", "Andreas L.

Ontology mappings are often obtained by using a matching tool. Ontology merging is the creation of a new ontology from at least two source ontologies. In Ontology merging, establishing mappings between source ontologies is the primitive step. Ontology matching tools can be used for establishing mappings, but different matching tools often give dissimilar ontology mappings. Human intervention may not solve the problem because distinct perspectives and understandings also lead to different mappings. Attempts to face the problems have been studied in the literature. All these attempts focus on finding erroneous mappings and finding one consensual mapping. In this paper, we suggest that under some conditions, mappings can be combined to get benefits from each of them. Mappings satisfying those conditions are name compatible mappings, we argue that the conditions mentioned above are based on Galois connections. Opposed to compatible mappings, incompatible mappings cannot be combined because their combination results in erroneous mappings.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.169", "authors": ["Muhammad Aun Abbas\n,", "Giuseppe Berio"], "references": ["J.

Synergies between semantic technologies and service discovery facilitate rich and formal representations of services and agent interactions as well as specialization and generalization of service needs. In this paper, we provide an extensive review of semantic Web service discovery, highlighting the state-of-the-art approaches, the key semantic formalisms employed, as well as benchmarks and testbeds for performance evaluation. Defining a generic framework for semantic service discovery, we describe the key tasks and criteria involved in agent-based computing. A detailed comparison of the popular discovery systems is performed with a discussion on trade-offs between existing approaches. We conclude by pointing out important research challenges to be addressed for next-generation service discovery by dynamic multi-agent systems in complex environments.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/s00779-012-0609-z", "authors": ["Le Duy Ngan\n,", "Rajaraman Kanagasabai"], "references": ["Wooldridge M (2009) An introduction to multiagent systems, 2nd edn.

A popular approach is to combine context-awareness with traditional recommendation engines in order to evaluate the relevance of a large amount of items for a given situation and user. Within this work we propose a general software architecture as well as a prototypical implementation for a framework that combines traditional recommendation methods with a variable number of context dimensions, such as location of social context. This work shows how to use a MapReduce programming model for aggregating the necessary information for calculating fast context-aware recommendations.

The file abstraction refactors I/O scheduling and placement for extreme parallelism and non-uniform memory and I/O. The system includes a set-associative, parallel page cache in the user space. We redesign page caching to eliminate CPU overhead and lock-contention in non-uniform memory architecture machines. We evaluate our design on a 32 core NUMA machine with four, eight-core processors. Experiments show that our design delivers 1.23 million 512-byte read IOPS. The page cache realizes the scalable IOPS of Linux asynchronous I/O (AIO) and increases user-perceived I/O performance linearly with cache hit rates. The parallel, set-associative cache matches the cache hit rates of the global Linux page cache under real workloads.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2503210.2503225", "authors": ["Da Zheng\n,", "Randal Burns\n,", "Alexander S.

Email repositories are tacit store-houses of knowledge about people, projects and processes. Mining one's own email repository can also provide interesting and valuable insights about his or her engagements and contacts along different dimensions. In this paper, we propose an email analytics framework that combines text-mining, network analysis and data analytics principles to mine email repositories for useful insights. While individuals are more attuned to looking at emails as individual items along with a history that is embedded in the trail, mining the whole collection can also lead to knowledge-discovery about similarities and dissimilarities of different engagements. This in turn can lead to valuable information like comparative status reports on various projects or deeper insights about why certain projects succeed while others don't. Given the volumes, diversity and noisy nature of e-mails, it becomes impossible for human beings to comprehend the impact of all of it unless the task is automated and approached in a structured fashion. We show that combination of text and network analytics along with temporal reasoning can provide valuable insights about task-states, actionable items, recommendations and forecasts. These insights can be exploited very effectively for project-management tasks like automated identification of bottlenecks or their causes, elimination of inefficiencies, early-warnings and suggestions about proactive measures to avoid problems. It is possible to extend the framework quite easily to analyze multiple email repositories of different users, though this work does not address the privacy or security concerns that might exist.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.78", "authors": ["Lipika Dey\n,", "H.

However, social activities often give rise to multiple network structures and some may be more effective in achieving the communication objectives than others. This led us to investigate a problem: given an observed sequence of messages and a social network that includes individuals involved in messaging, does the network structure 'explain' the observed propagation. To facilitate this investigation, we designed a method for encoding propagation events relative to the structure of a given network. The resulting transmission codes capture both the temporal and the structural characteristics of the propagation. We analyze the codes for maximal repeats and k-common sub strings to uncover dynamic network motifs within the propagation trace. By considering the dynamic motifs and the connected graph components, we can determine how the propagation events relate to the specific network. As a case study, we applied our method to rumor topics in Twitter and analyzed their propagation trails relative to the 'follower' network. The study demonstrates the computational feasibility of our approach and illustrates the use of dynamic motifs to reason about the impact of follower relationship rumor propagation in Twitter.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.64", "authors": ["Vladimir Barash\n,", "Natasa Milic-Frayling\n,", "Marc A.

Without changing the existing Web contents and page-layouts, two levels of visual supports addable onto any existing web page are suggested: (1) at micro level, visual cues encoding additional information are directly bound to particular hypermedia items, and (2) at macro level, additional visual layers are flexibly attached onto the browsed web pages.

Traditionally, to understand what issues a congressman found import, interested constituents would synthesize voting records, bills, and other disparate data sets to understand their congressman's habits. Fortunately, technology can now be used to integrate and display this information in an informative and visually appealing way. In response to this need to understand the behavior of congressmen, we have developed a mobile-based search and data mining application that provides users with the ability to analyze a large amount of social media data from Twitter, as well as data from the United States Congressional voting records. The application is focused on identifying patterns, anomalies, and associations between members of congress and external users to determine influential users within and outside Congress. This paper introduces the motivation behind the application -- Kongress - and then progresses into the system architecture. The applications features include the ability to search congressional tweets, votes, and bills, and a geospatial visualization of congressional tweets. We also demonstrate how a user could use Kongress to understand the motivation behind a congressman' decisions.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2525314.2525328", "authors": ["Douglas Grosvenor\n,", "Jeffrey Kendall\n,", "Amy Sanders\n,", "Chang-Tien Lu"], "references": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/facebook-1-billion-users_n_1938675.html", "http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57448388-93/twitter-hits-400-million-tweets-per-day-mostly-mobile/", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2012/06/28/social-media-and-the-big-data-explosion/", "http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/Transforming-Social-Media-Data-into-Predictive-Analytics-85687.aspx", "http://www.customerthink.com/article/from_big_data_to_big_decisions_3_ways_analytics_can_improve_retail_experience", "http://www.public.asu.edu/~pgundech/book_chapter/smm.pdf", "M.

We managed two runs using the Indri search retrieval system as official submission. However, post-submission, we experimented with ten different models using the TERRIER system. With the available qrels, we could evaluate only the runs pertaining to Consumer Law. Initial results have shown substantial improvement in retrieval performance. Our experimentation has also resulted in preparing a cookbook for optimal parameter-setting for a number of Terrier models. In Identification and Classification of Propositions in Court Judgment (parse each judgment into individual propositions), we have written a program which takes a single file as an input from the corpus and breaks the data of the given file into individual sentences. In summary, ours was a rich learning experience which needs to be continued to gain further insights.

Many hashing methods have been successfully applied in real-world applications like the mobile product search. The performance of these applications usually highly relies on the quality of hash bits. However, it still lacks of a general method that can provide good hash bits for different scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can select compact, independent and informative hash bits using the Markov Process. Our method can serve as a unified framework compatible with different hashing methods. We design two algorithms, BS-CMP and BS-DMP, and formulate the selection problem as the subgraph discovery on a graph. Experiments are conducted for two important selection scenarios when applying hash techniques, i.e., hashing using different hashing algorithms and hashing with multiple features.

With ongoing advances in computer and sensor technologies, we can expect robot applications for covering large areas that often require coordinated/cooperative activities by multiple robots. In this paper, we focus the cleaning tasks by multiple robots or by agents, software to control the robots. We assume that agents cannot directly exchange internal information such as plans and targets for coordination, but rather individually learn their target decision strategies by observing how much trash/dirt has been vacuumed up in the multi-agent system environments. We experimentally evaluated the proposed method by comparing its performance with those obtained by the regimes of agents with a single strategy.

They cause large-scale damage, create disruptions, and need instant reaction. In the event of sudden onset of a crisis, rapid formulation of a notification strategy, timely dispatch of alerts, and action on those alerts are important elements of early warning systems that can save lives. However, current methods of disaster alerting lack in the area of targeted communication of hazard information. Location data of the population available as a spatial data stream can allow dynamic identification of homogeneous clusters of people. Crisis notifications can then be targeted by personalizing information and instructions for each cluster. In this paper, we present an approach for dynamically partitioning a region into areas around a hazard using clustering of real-time streaming data to aid emergency response management. We lay down important requirements for the clustering technique from the perspective of our scenario and select an algorithm for our implementation after comparison with others. We employ a weighted distance measure and demonstrate the performance of our model in different settings through a series of experiments using a dataset of cell tower locations of users in Ivory Coast in Africa.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2534303.2534307", "authors": ["Paras Mehta\n,", "Agnès Voisard\n,", "Sebastian Müller"], "references": ["Global survey of early warning systems.

In MAL, exploration of one agent affects other agents' learning, acting in a manner similar to a noise factor, however, exploration is necessary to acquire suitable behaviors and to catch-up changes in a nonstationary environment. The MAL process is formalized from the viewpoint of the learning of probability distribution, where the purpose of learning is defined as maximization of the probability to select the right choice that provides greater benefit than other choices. For the learning, an agent needs to explore all actions to check and confirm that the right action is taken, especially in a nonstationary environment, which by its natuer may cause a change the right action over time even if other agents do not change their policies. On the basis of the proposed formalization, a simple case of resource sharing problems is investigated to show the existence of learning performance boundaries that limit MAL convergence to the right policy during learning.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.125", "authors": ["Itsuki Noda"], "references": ["K.

The adversary aims at changing the result of computations and/or learning the data processed by the stations of the subnetwork.\nWe develop and formally analyze two protocols that enable to detect adversarial manipulations without sacrificing efficiency of the data aggregation. Our scheme is not protected from adversary attaining to destroy communication. However, any manipulation is detected w.h.p.

The second one is very efficient in terms of communication volume and computational complexity.

Current work on healthcare informatics is highly interdisciplinary involving methodologies from computing, engineering, information science, behavior science, management science, social science, as well as many different areas in medicine and public health. Three major tracks, (i) systems, (ii) analytics, and (iii) human factors, can be identified. The systems track focuses on healthcare system architecture, framework, design, engineering, and application; the analytics track emphasizes data/information processing, retrieval, mining, analytics, as well as knowledge discovery; the human factors track targets the understanding of users or context, interface design, and user studies of healthcare applications. In this article, we discuss some of the latest development and introduce several articles selected for this special issue. We envision that the development of computing-oriented healthcare informatics research will continue to grow rapidly. The integration of different disciplines to advance the healthcare and wellbeing of our society will also be accelerated.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2555810.2555811", "authors": ["Christopher C.

These heterogeneous resources may share entities or contain similar ones. To cope with the diversity of these resources and collect them, resources repositories have been created. Matching entities belonging to different resources is then required to use or combine them, which generates alignment resources. Thus, collecting and managing resulting alignments is useful in order to compose them, compare sets of alignments for the same input resources, enrich existing alignments from each other or enhance their quality. In this paper we introduce our approach for building a repository of heterogeneous alignments. We propose to represent alignments by means of a generic model and we introduce some operators and algorithms to import, compose, intersect and merge alignments. For a concrete application we use ontology alignments and parallel corpora.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.175", "authors": ["Nizar Ghoula\n,", "Hervé Nindanga\n,", "Gilles Falquet"], "references": ["E.

Collaborative filtering recommends items to new users based on their similar neighbours, and content-based filtering approach tries to recommend items that are similar to new users' profiles. The fundamental issues include how to profile new users, and how to deal with the over-specialization in content-based recommender systems. Indeed, the terms used to describe items can be formed as a concept hierarchy. Therefore, we aim to describe user profiles or information needs by using concepts vectors. This paper presents a new method to acquire user information needs, which allows new users to describe their preferences on a concept hierarchy rather than rating items. It also develops a new ranking function to recommend items to new users based on their information needs. The proposed approach is evaluated on Amazon book datasets.

This causes mistakes with severe consequences, which is the reason that support systems for intelligence analysts have been developed. The support system proposed in this paper assists humans by offering support that improves their performance, without reducing them in their freedom. This is done with a trust-based question answering system (T-QAS). An important part of T-QAS are trust models which keep track of trust in each of the agents gathering information. Using these trust models, the system can support the intelligence analyst by: 1) helping to decide which agents are trusted enough to receive questions, 2) providing information about the reliability of each of the sources used, and 3) advising in making decisions based on information from possibly unreliable sources. An implementation of last two capabilities of T-QAS is evaluated in an experiment in which participants perform a decision making task with information from possibly unreliable sources. Results show that the proposed T-QAS support indeed helps participants to improve their performance. We therefore expect that future intelligence analyst support systems can benefit from the inclusion of T-QAS.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.179", "authors": ["Maaike de Boer\n,", "Peter-Paul van Maanen\n,", "Gerard Vreeswijk"], "references": ["M.

This approach is performed by an agent-based architecture where all systems, both products and manufacturing systems, have an agent that represents them. This is seen as a new manufacturing paradigm, called Grid Manufacturing. Grids can ideally be set up in such a way that a range of products can be produced dynamically and in parallel, depending on the demand the logistic systems might even be configured in such a way that products can move freely between manufacturing systems to offer more flexibility. This paper describes the necessary steps for the decomposition of the product definition, the manufacturing process and the involved architecture. The chosen platforms to perform these tasks are Multi Agent Systems and Robot Operating System, to create a hybrid architecture that fully utilizes performance, stability and the dynamic behavior of these distributed platforms. As a result the manufacturing systems can easily be adapted to the current product demand, which shortens the time to market for new products and makes it easier to scale the production means. This is especially interesting for high mix, low volume production, which is becoming more important in the high-tech and creative industry.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.104", "authors": ["Daniel Telgen\n,", "Leo van Moergestel\n,", "Erik Puik\n,", "Arjen van Zanten\n,", "Ammar Abdulamir\n,", "John-Jules Meyer"], "references": ["H.A.

But, complete assimilation of such massive amounts of data in its raw form is a daunting task. Automated text mining methods such as text summarization present the user with a condensed version of data containing only key information. This is especially useful in the case of online user forums that contain a large number of posts spread out across several threads. Document summarization methods have been extensively studied and several methods have been developed in the recent past. This paper aims at developing a new method for automatic summarization of online forums by using topic models and content/metadata sensitive clustering.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.182", "authors": ["Janani Krishnamani\n,", "Yanjun Zhao\n,", "Rajshekar Sunderraman"], "references": ["Rachit Arora and Balaraman Ravindran.

In this work, we model the social context of the person as the status messages generated by those socially associated people and propose a method to use his social context to improve the web search query expansion process for him. Our method extracts and ranks keywords from the status messages, which are relevant with the initial search query that is to be expanded. The selected keyword is then appended with the initial query to form socially expanded query. We show that useful search queries can be formed in terms of specialization and parallel movement, if we use the socially expanded query for further expansion using traditional expansion processes. Our method ensures privacy by keeping the social network data segregated from search engine vendors. Moreover, we provide directions for implementing this method without the intervention of search engine vendors. Nevertheless, the background search process is considered to be provided by search engine vendors in the form of Application Program Interface (API).", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2539150.2539266", "authors": ["Sheikh Muhammad Sarwar\n,", "Md.

To address this, natural language information retrieval techniques are increasingly being used to suggest potential faulty source files given bug reports. While these techniques are very scalable, in practice their effectiveness remains low in accurately localizing bugs to a small number of files. Our key insight is that structured information retrieval based on code constructs, such as class and method names, enables more accurate bug localization. We present BLUiR, which embodies this insight, requires only the source code and bug reports, and takes advantage of bug similarity data if available. We build BLUiR on a proven, open source IR toolkit that anyone can use. Our work provides a thorough grounding of IR-based bug localization research in fundamental IR theoretical and empirical knowledge and practice. We evaluate BLUiR on four open source projects with approximately 3,400 bugs. Results show that BLUiR matches or outperforms a current state-of-theart tool across applications considered, even when BLUiR does not use bug similarity data used by the other tool.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/ASE.2013.6693093", "authors": ["Ripon K.

In this paper we focus on a dynamic model for forming stable coalitions of selfish agents. Specifically, we consider the dynamic coalition formation approach proposed by Arnold and Schwalbe, where agents decides at each time step which of the existing coalition to join so to maximise their pay-off. We propose several key extensions to the approach to speed-up convergence and alleviate the computational burden for the agents. Our empirical analysis comprises two complementary scenarios: collective energy purchasing, where a set of energy consumer forms coalition to buy energy at reduced tariffs, and a synthetic benchmarking scenario. Our results in these scenarios indicate that our proposed extensions provide a speed-up in run time of up to four orders of magnitude with respect to the original approach.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.100", "authors": ["Filippo Bistaffa\n,", "Alessandro Farinelli"], "references": ["T.

Service providers have to consider how to design composite services to meet requirements from various users. However, QoS of composite service is difficult to evaluate and predict due to the uncertainty and multiple metrics of QoS, which makes it necessary for user-centered design of composite services. Moreover, combining human services and Web services is becoming an important issue in service composition in cases that Web services cannot meet the requirements from users. Therefore, it is necessary to test the service composition environments for human-computer interaction and study human behaviors. In this paper, we address the above issues by proposing a participatory service design approach based on user-centered QoS considering a real-world case of field-based multi-language communication service design. To achieve this goal, we first describe the QoS model for service design considering users' requirements. Then, we propose the participatory service design process, consisting of service model refinement, participatory simulation, QoS evaluation and QoS data update. Finally, we use the field study of multi-language service design for Vietnamese agricultural knowledge communication to illustrate our proposed design methodology.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.205", "authors": ["Donghui Lin\n,", "Toru Ishida"], "references": ["T.

With many people joining in the dating network, users become overwhelmed by choices for an ideal partner. A solution to this problem is providing users with partners recommendation based on their interests and activities. Traditional recommendation methods ignore the users' needs and provide recommendations equally to all users. In this paper, we propose a recommendation approach that employs different recommendation strategies to different groups of members. A segmentation method using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is proposed to customize users' needs. Then a targeted recommendation strategy is applied to each identified segment.

We have generated a geo-parser specifically to find locations in unstructured Spanish text. Our novel geo-parser architecture combines the results of four parsers: a lexico-semantic Named Location Parser, a rules-based building parser, a rules-based street parser, and a trained Named Entity Parser. Each parser has different strengths: the Named Location Parser is strong in recall, and the Named Entity Parser is strong in precision, and building and street parser finds buildings and streets that the others are not designed to do. To test our Spanish geo-parser performance, we compared the output of Spanish text through our Spanish geo-parser, with that same Spanish text translated into English and run through our English geo-parser. The results were that the Spanish geo-parser identified toponyms with an F1 of .796, and the English geo-parser identified toponyms with an F1 of .861 (and this is despite errors introduced by translation from Spanish to English), compared to an F1 of .114 from a commercial off-the-shelf Spanish geo-parser. Results suggest (1) geo-parsers should be built specifically for unstructured text, as have our Spanish and English geo-parsers, and (2) location entities in Spanish that have been machine translated to English are robust to geo-parsing in English.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2533888.2533943", "authors": ["Judith Gelernter\n,", "Wei Zhang"], "references": ["Angel, A., Lontou, C. and Pfoser, D.

Therefore we need a mechanism that recommends us suitable applications, which should depend on a user's context because he/she uses his/her devices differently in every context. This paper shows that it follows a power law what applications a user executes in daily life, and proposes a novel approach to find context-aware applications in the mobile devices. This approach is based on the term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), which is used for extracting important keywords in a document. Moreover, we propose an application recommendation mechanism using this approach.

A multimodal feature representation scheme is designed to exploit the complementarity of audio features, global and local visual features so that optimal overall robustness to a wide range of complicated modifications can be achieved. Meanwhile, a temporal pyramid matching algorithm is proposed to assemble frame-level similarity search results into sequence-level matching results through similarity evaluation over multiple temporal granularities. Additionally, inverted indexing and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) are also adopted to speed up similarity search. Experimental results over benchmarking datasets of TRECVID 2010 and 2009 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods for most transformations in terms of copy detection accuracy.

Data aggregation provides such tools by partitioning the system dimensions into aggregated pieces of information. Since this process leads to information losses, the partitions should be chosen with the greatest caution. While the number of possible partitions grows exponentially with the size of the system, this paper proposes an algorithm that exploits exogenous constraints regarding the system semantics in order to find the best partitions in a linear or polynomial time. Two constrained sets of partitions (hierarchical and ordered) are detailed and applied to spatial and temporal aggregation of an agent-based model of international relations. The algorithm succeeds in providing meaningful high-level abstractions for the system analysis.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.138", "authors": ["Robin Lamarche-Perrin\n,", "Yves Demazeau\n,", "Jean-Marc Vincent"], "references": ["N.

Predicting the efficiency of a task is a crucial problem in unstructured environments as it enables the robot(s) to decide whether it is feasible to perform the task under the current environment conditions and within its available resources such as battery power. This problem is non-trivial as robot's performance changes during operation based on its operational conditions, available battery change, etc. In this paper, we have addressed this problem by using a learning-based technique that the robot uses to predict its expected efficiency for performing a new task based on the task's similarity and recentness with previously performed tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed technique can successfully predict the efficiency of a task from previous task experiences and this prediction gets better with number of tasks performed. We have also shown empirically that our model is robust to changes in environmental conditions such as localization and wheel slip noise.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.157", "authors": ["Ayan Dutta\n,", "Prithviraj Dasgupta\n,", "José Baca\n,", "Carl Nelson"], "references": ["J.

Among others, most businesses, smaller or bigger, present themselves to the world through their websites. Economic development analysts could make use of the information available on business websites to identify ways in which businesses in a region can be grouped together into clusters, and possibly partnership for mutual benefit, and thus for economics gains of that particular region. Automated clustering of businesses is especially useful, as the existing NAICS codes-based clustering is not very accurate, according to domain experts, and does not scale up well. Text analysis is a blooming field whose goal is to automatically extract useful information from natural language text. In this work, we perform a preliminary text analysis of business websites to build business profiles and to organize businesses into clusters. Our approach is based on representing businesses as a mixture of ``topics\" using a technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Given the business profiles represented as the topic distributions obtained with LDA, we construct preliminary clusters of businesses. Manual analysis of the results shows that the proposed approach has the potential for giving interesting and useful clusters, which have the potential to replace the existing NAICS codes-based clusters. We identify further challenges associated with the existing business data, and several ideas for future work.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.45", "authors": ["Rohit Parimi\n,", "Doina Caragea\n,", "Dale Wunderlich"], "references": ["M.

This problem is well studied in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with a recall of 90% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art supervised classification approach. We get a significant improvement of 36% using the proposed algorithm.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.46", "authors": ["Ayush Singhal\n,", "Ravindra Kasturi\n,", "Vidyashankar Sivakumar\n,", "Jaideep Srivastava"], "references": ["K.

The output will comprise a recommendation of potentially \"interesting\" or \"useful\" visualizations, where each visualization is coupled with a suitable query execution plan. We discuss the technical challenges in building this system and outline an agenda for future research.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/2732240.2732250", "authors": ["Aditya Parameswaran\n,", "Neoklis Polyzotis\n,", "Hector Garcia-Molina"], "references": ["K.

The main drawback of this approach is the missing consideration of the users previous cross-site browsing experience resulting in an often fragmented browsing experience. This paper introduces a service driven architecture for user-centric personalisation in online cross-site tasks. The goal of the architecture is twofold: (1) to provide non-intrusive personalised recommendations to the user by not interfering in their browsing freedom and (2) to introduce cross-site personalisation in a non-invasive manner, thus not interfering with the design and functionality of the overall website. We introduce the proposed architecture and its applicability across separately hosted open-source Web-based Content Management Systems (WCMS). We also discuss encouraging results of an initial task-based experiment concentrating on the user's perception of non-intrusive personalisation within and across different websites.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.76", "authors": ["Kevin Koidl\n,", "Owen Conlan\n,", "Vincent Wade"], "references": ["P.

In RDF, every piece of information is represented as a triple: subject-property-object. In general, subjects and objects can be shared between multiple RDF triples, and all triples can constitute a densely interlinked network. RDF becomes a very popular format of representing data on the web. As of September 2012, the last available data, more than 31 billions of triples exist on the web. In the paper, we propose a system - called T2R - for automatic acquisition of syntactic and semantic relations among terms from a plain text. These relations are expressed in the form of RDF triples. The proposed method is independent of any prior knowledge and domain specific patterns, and is applicable to any textual resources. The system implementing the approach is capable of identifying grammatical structure of an input sentence and analysing its semantics to generate meaningful RDF triples. We evaluate this approach by proving the quality of our results through case studies.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.187", "authors": ["Kimia Hassanzadeh\n,", "Marek Reformat\n,", "Witold Pedrycz\n,", "Iqbal Jamal\n,", "John Berezowski"], "references": ["M.

It implies that the pattern of the influence propagation should be updated dynamically to reflect the flow of influence spread to better capture the rapidly changing dynamics of microblogs. Our proposed scheme is therefore practical and feasible to be deployed in the real world.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.58", "authors": ["Pei-Ying Huang\n,", "Hsin-Yu Liu\n,", "Chin-Hui Chen\n,", "Pu-Jen Cheng"], "references": ["P.-Y.

Consequently, real-time recommendation systems require very efficient algorithm to quickly proceed this massive amount of data. In this paper we propose a scalable and extensible way of building content-based user profiles. Scalability refers to the relative complexity of algorithms involved in building the users profiles with respect to state-of-the-art solutions. Extensibility consider avoiding to recompute the model for newcomers. We present a tractable algorithm to build user profiles out of their tweets. Our model is a graph of terms cooccurency, driven by the fact that user sharing similar interests will share similar terms. We then present how this model can be encoded as a binary footprint, hence boosting comparison of users. We provide an empirical study to measure how the distance between users in the hash space differs from distance between users using standard Information Retrieval techniques. This experiment is based on a Twitter dataset we crawled, and represents 25K users and 1 million tweets. Our approach is driven by real-time analysis requirements and is thus oriented on a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Experimental results shows that our approach outperforms vector space model by three orders of magnitude, with a precision of 58%.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.15", "authors": ["Julien Subercaze\n,", "Christophe Gravier\n,", "Frédérique Laforest"], "references": ["J.

Although keyword-based methods are superior in achieving faster detection, they fail to detect text content that is semantically objectionable. A novel framework based on adaptive topic modeling is proposed to detect objectionable text content. Firstly, a weighted graph is constructed based on several seed words and a set of training texts. Feature words are then selected from the graph according to the measure which shows how likely a word to be sensitive. Adaptive LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model in which topic number can be automatically estimated is proposed to find the latent objectionable topic structure for the text set. An objectionable topic criterion is devised for the adaptive selection method which takes the objectionable topic characteristic into consideration. Finally, detection for a given text is evaluated based on its probability value with respect to the model. Extensive comparison experiments on real world text sets show that the proposed method can effectively detect objectionable text. The performance is superior to that of keyword-based methods with several different approaches to generate keyword list. Experiments also show that the performance is better than that of detection methods based on traditional topic modeling.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.54", "authors": ["Jianping Zeng\n,", "Jiangjiao Duan\n,", "Chengrong Wu"], "references": ["N.

This modeling approach is consistent with the agent-oriented view of processes as emerging from the interactions and local behaviors of autonomous entities (or \"subjects\").

This paper lays the conceptual foundations for extending this scope to include both human and artificial agents, across all levels of industrial control and spanning entire value chains.

These sensors continuously stream geo-referenced videos, which provide enormous amounts of data. Efficiently searching through these long-duration video corpuses based on location and time is a challenging task. We propose a novel approach to efficiently store frequent timestamped geographical tags in a spatial database to enable searching the video files within a short response time. Further, we enable retrieving segments of the full video that satisfy certain spatio-temporal conditions in a ranked manner. Our approach achieves short response times as compared to standard methods for saving geographic tags in a spatial database.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2525314.2525446", "authors": ["Flora Gilboa-Solomon\n,", "Gal Ashour\n,", "Ophir Azulai"], "references": ["Aizawa, K., Tancharoen, D., Kawasaki, S., & Yamasaki, T.

Our method can classify digital photographs without using pixel information. When an interesting event occurs, many people take photographs of the event.

However, a simple method that transmits the image data may causes congestion of communication network. In this paper, we propose a highly available classification system. Our method estimates subjects of digital photographs using only information about a state of a camera when photographed, and classify the photographs based on the subject. We can suppress congestion because the system preferentially transmits photographs that meets a browse request of viewers.

SLD aims to specify whether two randomly selected stories discuss the same topic or not. This sub-task drew special attention within the TDT research community as many tasks in TDT are thought to be solved automatically once SLD performs as expected. In this study, performance tests were carried out on the BilCol-2005 Turkish news corpus composed of approximately 209,000 news items using vector space model (VSM) and relevance model (RM) methods with respect to varied index term counts. Accordingly, best results obtained were as follows: the VSM method performed best with 30 terms (F-measure=0.2970) while RM method did with 4 terms (F-measure=0.1910). Furthermore, the combination of two methods using the AND and OR functions increased the precision ratio by 7.9% and recall ratio by 1.2%, respectively, indicating that retrieval performance of SLD algorithms can be increased to some extent by employing both VSM and RM models.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.23", "authors": ["Güven Köse\n,", "Yasar Tonta\n,", "Hamid Ahmadlouei\n,", "Aydin Can Polatkan"], "references": ["Lavrenko, V.

Aitchison used to introduce the additive-logratio transformation (alr) and centered logratio transformation (clr) in 1986, which are effective tools to solve the problem of compositional data. But those approaches are not isometry ways, and the interpretation of transformed data might be different from the expected properties. Then Egozcue put forward the isometric logratio transformation, which can transform the simplex space into the real Euclidean space. This paper aims at introducing a new approach to calculate the correlation of two sets of compositional data. This approach based on the isometric logratio transformation can preserve all metric properties and solve the problem of calculation of correlation coefficient on compositional data.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.210", "authors": ["Wen Long\n,", "Qian Wang"], "references": ["Aitchison, J.

Interactive image database browsing systems provide an interesting alternative to retrieval-based approaches as they let the user explore an image dataset in an intuitive fashion. Based on content-based concepts, large image collections are visualised so that visually similar images are located close to each other in the visualisation space. Once displayed, the user can then interactively browse through the image collection. The main approaches to visualising and browsing image collections are mapping-based techniques, which are based on dimensionality reduction, and clustering-based methods, that group similar images together. In this paper, we highlight how these two approaches can be effectively combined to devise an intuitive image database navigation system that has low computational requirements, both offline and online, and organises images based on colour content on a spherical visualisation space while providing hierarchical access to large image datasets.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556871.2556873", "authors": ["Gerald Schaefer"], "references": ["R.

Fast response to queries is a critical service expectation. The well-known WAND processing strategy is one way of reducing the amount of computation necessary when executing such a query. The value of WAND has now been validated in a wide range of studies, and has become one of the key baselines against which all new top-k processing algorithms are benchmarked. However, most previous implementations of WAND-based retrieval approaches have been in the context of the BM25 Okapi similarity scoring regime. Here we measure the performance of WAND in the context of the alternative Language Model similarity score computation, and find that the dramatic efficiency gains reported in previous studies are no longer achievable. That is, when the primary goal of a retrieval system is to maximize effectiveness, WAND is relatively unhelpful in terms of attaining the secondary objective of maximizing query throughput rates. However, the BM-WAND algorithm does in fact help reducing the percentage of postings to be scored, but with additional computational overhead. We explore a variety of tradeoffs between scoring metric and processing regime and present new insight into how score-safe algorithms interact with rank scoring.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2537734.2537744", "authors": ["Matthias Petri\n,", "J.

Finding an optimal route for each trip and purpose which corresponds to their preferences is often difficult. People frequently consult route planning services which offer them to choose between the calculation of the fastest or most direct route, and sometimes even the most scenic route. As soon as several transportation modes are involved, the range of routing planners taking into account multiple modes of transportation is either strictly limited or no such service at all is available.\nIn this position paper we outline a proposal for making mobility in urban areas healthier. The healthification of urban mobility will be supported by a health-atlas platform. The core of this platform will be a routing service that incorporates all available and possible modes of transportation, and proposes to its users the healthiest path between an origin and a destination. Determining such route will take into account individual preferences and personal mobility restrictions; it will also be based on the involved level of physical activity and exposure to polluted air along the route which often varies for different modes of transportation. Information about air pollution will not only be obtained from official measuring stations but also by the users themselves, through geo-referenced air quality measurements with their mobile devices. These data will then be made available through the health-atlas in a crowd-sensing manner and thus provides a real-time air pollution snapshot.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2535708.2535713", "authors": ["Dominik Allemann\n,", "Martin Raubal"], "references": ["Air Quality Egg.

The harmony of this relation and survival of this socio-technical world can only be guaranteed if machines can understand the human state of mind and can act accordingly.

In the current paper a model of trust based human decision making in dynamic environment is taken from the literature and validated against the human decision traces generated through computer based experiments. The results of this experiment shows that model under study can be trusted as to be a computational representative of human decision making process with a satisfactory level.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.181", "authors": ["Fahad Mansoor\n,", "Muhammad Rohail\n,", "Syed Waqar Jaffry"], "references": ["Hoogendoorn, M., Jaffry, S.W., and Treur, J., Exploration and Exploitation in Adaptive Trust-Based Decision Making in Dynamic Environments.

Our algorithm builds on the assumption that prominent actors collaborate on prominent objects, and prominent objects are naturally grouped into prominent clusters or groups (hyperedges in a graph). iHypR makes use of the relationships between actors, objects, and hyperedges to compute a global prominence score for the actors in the network. We do not assume the hyperedges are given in advance. Hyperedges computed by our method can perform as well or even better than “true” hyperedges. Our algorithm is customized for networks of collaborations, but it is generally applicable without further tuning. We show, through extensive experimentation with three real-life data sets and multiple external measures of prominence, that our algorithm outperforms existing well-known algorithms. Our work is the first to offer such an extensive evaluation. We show that unlike most existing algorithms, the performance is robust across multiple measures of performance. Further, we give a detailed study of the sensitivity of our algorithm to different data sets and the design choices within the algorithm that a user may wish to change. Our article illustrates the various trade-offs that must be considered in computing prominence in collaborative social networks.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2541268.2541269", "authors": ["Sibel Adali\n,", "Malik Magdon-Ismail\n,", "Xiaohui Lu"], "references": ["Adali, S., Lu, X., Magdon-Ismail, M., and Purnell, J. 2011.

Mr. Scan avoids the problems of existing implementations by effectively partitioning the point space and by optimizing DBSCAN's computation over dense data regions. We tested Mr. Scan on both a geolocated Twitter dataset and image data obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At its largest scale, Mr. Scan clustered 6.5 billion points from the Twitter dataset on 8,192 GPU nodes on Cray Titan in 17.3 minutes.

However, despite the several advances in the field, these systems still face scenario adaptability and practical implementation issues. In light of these issues, we developed a nonspecific method for emotional state classification in interactive environments. The proposed method employs a two-layer classification process to detect Arousal and Valence (the emotion's hedonic component), based on four psycho physiological metrics: Skin Conductance, Heart Rate and Electromyography measured at the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major muscles. The first classification layer applies multiple regression models to correctly scale the aforementioned metrics across participants and experimental conditions, while also correlating them to the Arousal or Valence dimensions. The second layer then explores several machine learning techniques to merge the regression outputs into one final rating. The obtained results indicate we are able to classify Arousal and Valence independently from participant and experimental conditions with satisfactory accuracy (97% for Arousal and 91% for Valence).", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.117", "authors": ["Pedro A.

An important novelty of our work is the application of evidential reasoning techniques, namely the Demspter-Shafer Theory (DST), for this problem. By utilizing several features of tweets, we aim to produce belief intervals for a set of possible discrete locations.

One of the most frequently used mobile queries is range queries - retrieving surrounding objects of interest. As mobile devices are moving, these range queries are literally moving range queries. The main problem of processing mobile moving range queries is how to know when the surrounding objects of interest are no longer relevant (and the previously distant objects of interest have become relevant) since the mobile device has already moved to a new location. Past researches have proposed the use of safe region - an area where the set of objects of interest to the mobile device does not change. However, when the query leaves the safe region, the mobile device has to reprocess the query. Knowing when and where the mobile device will leave a safe region is widely known as a difficult problem. To solve this problem, we propose two novel methods: (i) efficient construction of the safe region by using only two objects closest to the border of the moving mobile device, and (ii) periodic monitoring the position of the mobile device. Our evaluation shows that our method enlarges the safe region compared with previous methods, giving the mobile device a wider range to roam, and therefore, reducing computation and communication costs.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2536853.2536899", "authors": ["Haidar Al-Khalidi\n,", "David Taniar\n,", "John Betts\n,", "Sultan Alamri"], "references": ["M.

In this paper, we present a method for incorporating knowledge of the structure of scientific data and executing query into the MapReduce communication model. Built in SciHadoop, a version of the Hadoop MapReduce framework for scientific data, SIDR intelligently partitions and routes intermediate data, allowing it to: remove Hadoop's global barrier and execute Reduce tasks prior to all Map tasks completing; minimize intermediate key skew; and produce early, correct results.

More people now browse the internet from their smart phones and tablets than ever before. At the same time the web is evolving and web pages are becoming more complicated in terms of both layout and content. The intersection of the two, that is, viewing these web pages on mobile devices poses serious challenges due to the severely constrained screen dimensions of these devices. Newer websites have started to provide mobile versions of their sites that are adapted for viewing on mobile devices. However, most of the content on the web remains unsuitable for viewing on mobile devices, especially static HTML pages that precede CSS3. This paper presents an approach to solve this problem by considering each web page as a composition of content blocks. It attempts to identify blocks most relevant to the content of the page and the relationships between them. It then rearranges these blocks in a way that preserves their prominence and the relationships between them. Displaying relevant content blocks prominently would preserve the intent of the author.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.22", "authors": ["Rajorshi G.

More specifically, the proposed Personalized, Location-Aware Tourist Information System (PLATIS) collects personal data from users' social network profiles and destination data from several online sources and conceptualizes this information into corresponding ontologies with the help of Semantic Web.

Although there are some techniques which obtain relatively good precision and recall values when segmenting the video in scenes, they are somewhat limited because the high computational cost. A well know technique to accomplish video scene segmentation is the shot coherence model, which presents lower precision and recall than state of art methods, like machine learning and multimodality, but stands out for being simple. The improvement of the techniques based on shot coherence models could be beneficial to these state of the art segmentation methods.\nThat way, this paper presents a new technique for scene segmentation using shot coherence and optical flow features.

While other versions of the same content better suited to their device and network constraints may be available on other third-party hosting sites, these remain unusable because users cannot efficiently discover these and verify that these variants match the content publisher's original intent. Our vision is to enable consumers to leverage verifiable alternatives from different hosting sites that are best suited to their constraints to deliver a high quality of experience and enable content publishers to reach a wide audience with diverse operating conditions with minimal upfront costs. To this end, we make a case for information-bound references or IBRs that bind references to video content to the underlying information that a publisher wants to convey, decoupled from details such as protocols, hosts, file names, or the underlying bits.

However, new online services changed the meaning behind \"browsing the Web\" and require a fresh look at the problem. Platforms such as YouTube or last. Fm have started to replace the traditional media channels (cinema, television, radio) and media distribution formats (CD, DVD, Blu-ray). Particularly social networks (e.g., Facebook) attracted whole new, particularly less tech-savvy audiences. Advances in mobile technologies made browsing \"on-the-move\" the norm and changed the user behavior, often being influenced by the user's location and context in the physical world. Commonly used datasets, such as web server access logs or search engines transaction logs, are inherently not capable of capturing the browsing behavior of users in all these facets. DOBBS (DERI Online Behavior Study) is an effort to create such a dataset in a non-intrusive, completely anonymous and privacy-preserving way. DOBBS provides a browser add-on which keeps track of users' browsing behavior.

Rather than being based on the link structure between Web pages, the ranking of search results in the Social Semantic Web needs to be based on something new - we believe that it can be based on user preferences and underlying ontological knowledge. Modeling uncertainty is also playing an increasingly important role in these domains, since uncertainty can arise due to many uncontrollable factors. In this paper, we propose an extension of the Data log+/- ontology language with a model for representing preferences of groups of users and a model for representing the (probabilistic) uncertainty in the domain. Assuming that more probable answers are more preferable, this raises the question of how to rank query results, since the preferences of single users may be in conflict both with the probability-based preferences as well as with each other. To this end, we propose preference merging and aggregation operators, respectively, and study their semantic and computational properties. Based on these operators, we provide algorithms for answering k-rank queries for DAQs (disjunctions of atomic queries), which generalize top-k queries based on the iterative computation of classical skyline answers, and show that, under certain reasonable conditions, they run in polynomial time in the data complexity.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.26", "authors": ["Thomas Lukasiewicz\n,", "Maria Vanina Martinez\n,", "Gerardo I.

In cooperation settings when communication is available only during short periods, it is difficult to build joint policies of agents to collectively accomplish a mission defined by a set of tasks. The proposed approach aims to punctually coordinate the agents during ``Rendezvous'' phases defined by the short periods when communication is available. This approach consists of a series of simultaneous auctions to coordinate individual policies computed in a distributed way from Markov decision processes oriented by several goals. These policies allow the agents to evaluate their own relevance in each task achievement and to communicate bids when possible. This approach is illustrated on multi-mobile-robot missions similar to distributed traveling salesmen problem. Experimental results (through simulation and on real robots) demonstrate that high-quality allocations are quickly computed.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.92", "authors": ["Guillaume Lozenguez\n,", "Abdel-Illah Mouaddib\n,", "Aurelie Beynier\n,", "Lounis Adouane\n,", "Philippe Martinet"], "references": ["R.

Identifying a correct personal entity from the a piece of or the whole document is still a very challenging problem, especially for Chinese websites. In this paper, we propose a novel Ontology-based approach for Personal Name Disambiguation (named \"OnPerDis\"). This approach has two main steps: first, we construct person ontology (PO) with rich conceptual modeling as well as a large set of supporting instances, second, for a given personal name on the web, we create a temporary instance and extract features from the web documents, calculate the similarity between this temporary instance and the instances in the PO. The one with the highest similarity score is chosen as the appropriate personal name. Our extensive evaluations with two rich real-life datasets (CIPS-SIGHAN 2012 NERD and Chinese web documents) shows OnPerDis' efficacy on personal name disambiguation on the Web.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.28", "authors": ["Zhao Lu\n,", "Zhixian Yan\n,", "Liang He"], "references": ["M.

In such networks, members who fill their name fields with fictitious identities, company names, phone numbers, or just gibberish are violating the terms of service, polluting search results, and degrading the value of the site to real members. Finding and removing these accounts on the basis of their spammy names can both improve the site experience for real members and prevent further abusive activity.\nIn this paper we describe a set of features that can be used by a Naive Bayes classifier to find accounts whose names do not represent real people. The model can detect both automated and human abusers and can be used at registration time, before other signals such as social graph or clickstream history are present. We use member data from LinkedIn to train and validate our model and to choose parameters. Our best-scoring model achieves AUC 0.85 on a sequestered test set.\nWe ran the algorithm on live LinkedIn data for one month in parallel with our previous name scoring algorithm based on regular expressions. The false positive rate of our new algorithm (3.3%) was less than half that of the previous algorithm (7.0%).\nWhen the algorithm is run on email usernames as well as user-entered first and last names, it provides an effective way to catch not only bad human actors but also bots that have poor name and email generation algorithms.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2517312.2517314", "authors": ["David Mandell Freeman"], "references": ["I.

Proposed method provides a way to determine tune's internal homogeneity, which means detecting which parts of the tune sound typical to whole tune and which do not. Such information can be used for various purposes such as tune thumbnail creation or tune cleaning from untypical parts for further automatic analysis. In our method, we slice music piece into frames and compare these frames with the whole tune by means of Instantaneous Frequency Spectrum, which gives a comprehensive approximation of frames homogeneity. This approximation is then iteratively refined. The final result shows homogeneity of short frames to the whole tune. By setting different thresholds we can get desired level of accuracy. However, proposed automatic threshold shows good results throughout all experiments. Visual presentation of tune homogeneity gives a good description of a piece's internal structure.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2536853.2536894", "authors": ["Tatiana Endrjukaite\n,", "Yasushi Kiyoki"], "references": ["M.

In this paper we focus on a recent method called the support vector machines (SVM) has been adapted and applied to the problem of pattern recognition such as face detection. The idea information of the skin color is used to reduce the search region and the main idea based on SVM is to project the data input space (belonging to two different classes) non-linearly separable in a larger space called feature space so that data are linearly separable. About fusion a non-parametric model is applied for the segmentation of the pixels of skin color. This last is used to reduce area of research within the image. However the SVMs help us to find exactly the faces in the segmented area. We implemented the SVM using a RBF kernel as a classification technique for face detection by block\" approach of considering the face as a set of components (eyes, nose and mouth). The method succeeds in locating facial features in the facial region exactly and is insensitive to face deformation. The method is executable in a reasonably short time.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.212", "authors": ["Rachid Aliradi\n,", "Naima Bouzera\n,", "Abdelkrim Meziane\n,", "Abdelkader Belkhir"], "references": ["Ming-Hsuan Yang, David J.

A trajectory is defined as a sequence of places with each place having an associated text description with them. A top-k trajectory query consists of a set of locations and a set of activities, and returns a set of relevant trajectories to a user. A trajectory is considered more relevant if it has query activities at places nearby to the query locations. The proposed ranking measure helps to select highly relevant trajectories by capturing the correlation between trajectory places and activities while computing a trajectory relevance score. Previous works on Top-k trajectory query computed a trajectory relevance score either on the basis of spatial proximity or on the basis of combination of spatial proximity and textual similarity in some user defined proportion. These works did not consider association of spatial and textual dimensions, and hence may return trajectories that have query activities at trajectory places very far away from the query locations. In addition to the proposal of a ranking metric, we also give an algorithm to implement the proposed metric efficiently. Finally, we do an experimental study on a real dataset to demonstrate that the proposed ranking measure is indeed effective in terms of retrieval of trajectories that have query activities at places near to the query locations.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2533888.2533933", "authors": ["Vikram Goyal\n,", "Shamkant B.

These heterogeneous interactions convey the latent information for identifying meaningful user groups, namely social communities, which exhibit unique location-oriented characteristics. In this work, we aim to detect and profile social communities in LBSNs by representing the heterogeneous interactions with a multimodality nonuniform hypergraph. Here, the vertices of the hypergraph are users, venues, textual comments or photos and the hyperedges characterize the k-partite heterogeneous interactions such as posting certain comments or uploading certain photos while visiting certain places. We then view each detected social community as a dense subgraph within the heterogeneous hypergraph, where the user community is constructed by the vertices and edges in the dense subgraph and the profile of the community is characterized by the vertices related with venues, comments and photos and their inter-relations. We present an efficient algorithm to detect the overlapped dense subgraphs, where the profile of each social community is guaranteed to be available by constraining the minimal number of vertices in each modality. Extensive experiments on Foursquare data well validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of detecting meaningful social communities and uncovering their underlying profiles in LBSNs.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2502415", "authors": ["Yi-Liang Zhao\n,", "Qiang Chen\n,", "Shuicheng Yan\n,", "Tat-Seng Chua\n,", "Daqing Zhang"], "references": ["Amitay, E., Carmel, D., Har'El, N., Ofek-Koifman, S., Soffer, A., Yogev, S., and Golbandi, N. 2009.

This was the first year that the track was organized. We had proposed two subtasks as part of the challenge. In the first subtask, which we had proposed for Hindi, Bangla, and Gujarati, participants had to devise an algorithm to label the true languages of words in a sentence. Additionally, if a non-English word was identified, the algorithm was also supposed to provide the transliteration of the word in the native script. The second subtask was retrieval-based, where mixed-script documents had to be retrieved and ranked by relevance in response to ad hoc queries. The queries in our dataset were Bollywood Hindi song lyrics, in Roman script. We received a total of 25 run submissions from five different teams across the world (three from India and two from abroad). Conducting this track helped us generate awareness about the importance of transliteration in the context of Indian languages. Results show that there is considerable scope for improvement of transliteration accuracies for the studied languages.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2701336.2701636", "authors": ["Rishiraj Saha Roy\n,", "Monojit Choudhury\n,", "Prasenjit Majumder\n,", "Komal Agarwal"], "references": ["U.

Developers can change their vision and abandon features that are essential for certain users. Moreover, well funded attackers can effectively take control of a project by orchestrating the transfer of the leadership of the developers to people that they control. We propose a mechanism to reduce the level of trust that users are required to have in the maintainers of free and open-source agent software. In fact, with the proposed method, it is sufficient for the user to trust that his constellation of independent testers are safe from attack, even as all testers may be subject to different attacks. Our solution inserts independent intermediaries (testers) between the developers and the end-users. To encourage independence of the testers, essential for the desired security, a distributed recommendation mechanism is employed, suggesting testers for end-users based on preferences of immediate connections, and on the frequency of usage of these testers in her neighborhood.

They are off-line systems and are very popular in the developing world. However, they now face several challenges (e.g. geographical distance between participants, safety risks related to manual financial operations). An evolution towards on-line systems is now a necessity and this paper is a first step in that direction. It proposes an architecture which handles the participants of ROSCAs as end-users of a social network. The proposed social network accommodates poorly literate end-users who may live in areas with no Internet connection. It also integrates an on-line payment system. The rich cellular network connectivity that is commonplace in most developing countries is used to offset the poor Internet connectivity.

Currently there are questions about what degree of representativity of the physical population they have, and how population biases impact user-generated content. In this paper we focus on centralism, a problem affecting Chile. Assuming that local differences exist in a country, in terms of vocabulary, we built a methodology based on the vector space model to find distinctive content from different locations, and used it to create classifiers to predict whether the content of a micro-post is related to a particular location, having in mind a geographically diverse selection of micro-posts. We evaluate them in a case study where we analyze the virtual population of Chile that participated in the Twitter social network during an event of national relevance: the municipal (local governments) elections held in 2012. We observe that the participating virtual population is spatially representative of the physical population, implying that there is centralism in Twitter. Our classifiers out-perform a non geographically-diverse baseline at the regional level, and have the same accuracy at a provincial level.

There have been numerous suggestions for the addition of meso-level structures as a way to guide this emergence towards desirable outcomes or away from undesirable ones. However, it can be observed that the interaction of the micro and meso levels may cause unexpected properties to arise at all levels of the system. This paper investigates the interleaving of a self-adaptive micro level with a self-organising meso level to explain the macro-level system properties that may occur. A simulation-based test bench is used to perform experiments examining various compositions of adaptive mechanisms at the micro and meso levels of a multi-agent system. The results of these experiments are then analysed using a proposed formalism for multi-level adaptive systems to explain the observed interactions.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.124", "authors": ["David Sanderson\n,", "Jeremy Pitt\n,", "Dídac Busquets"], "references": ["M.

Traditionally, this task is accomplished by analyzing signals of wearable motion sensors. While such signals can effectively distinguish various low-level activities (e.g. walking or standing), two issues exist: First, high-level activities (e.g. watching movies or attending lectures) are difficult to distinguish from motion data alone. Second, instrumentation of complex body sensor network at population scale is impractical. In this work, we take an alternative approach of leveraging rich, dynamic, and crowd-generated self-report data as the basis for in-situ activity recognition. By treating the user as the \"sensor\", we make use of implicit signals emitted from natural use of mobile smart-phones. Applying an L1-regularized Linear SVM on features derived from textual content, semantic location, and time, we are able to infer 10 meaningful classes of daily life activities with a mean accuracy of up to 83.9%. Our work illustrates a promising first step towards comprehensive, high-level activity recognition using free, crowd-generated, social media data.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2541831.2541852", "authors": ["Zack Zhu\n,", "Ulf Blanke\n,", "Alberto Calatroni\n,", "Gerhard Tröster"], "references": ["L.

Some metrics were proposed in order to identify the web documents describing a business process. Identifying descriptions of business processes is a difficult task because the web stores \"bag-of-words\" documents. Hence, the ProcessSearch framework has been constructed and implemented, using known technologies in information retrieval and computational linguistics. The result was a satisfactory list of web documents ranked (top-k) by relevance for some given keywords. For validation, a \"precision at k\" analysis was used to confirm the accuracy of the proposed metrics.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2526188.2526223", "authors": ["Rodrigo Costa dos Santos\n,", "Geraldo Bonorino Xexéo\n,", "Fellipe Duarte\n,", "Paula Nascimento\n,", "Rodrigo Águas"], "references": ["T.

In this article, we present an indepth analysis of Web search queries for controversial topics, focusing on query sentiment. To this end, we conduct extensive user assessments and discriminative term analyses, as well as a sentiment analysis using the SentiWordNet thesaurus, a lexical resource containing sentiment annotations. Furthermore, in order to detect the sentiment expressed in queries, we build different classifiers based on query texts, query result titles, and snippets. We demonstrate the virtue of query sentiment detection in two different use cases. First, we define a query recommendation scenario that employs sentiment detection of results to recommend additional queries for polarized queries issued by search engine users. The second application scenario is controversial topic discovery, where query sentiment classifiers are employed to discover previously unknown topics that trigger both highly positive and negative opinions among the users of a search engine. For both use cases, the results of our evaluations on real-world data are promising and show the viability and potential of query sentiment analysis in practical scenarios.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2535525", "authors": ["Sergiu Chelaru\n,", "Ismail Sengor Altingovde\n,", "Stefan Siersdorfer\n,", "Wolfgang Nejdl"], "references": ["Ahmad, K. 2011.

In this work, we present a new approach to model opinion dynamics by treating the opinion on an issue as a product inferred from one's knowledge bases, where the knowledge bases keep growing and updating through social interaction. A general impact metric is proposed to evaluate the likelihood of a person adopting the opinions from others. Specifically, a set of domain-independent influential factors is selected based on social and communication theories, but the weights of these factors are missing. Though the opinions from different actors are not integrated linearly like traditional methods, we show that the factor weights can be efficiently learned via regression. We validated the effectiveness of our model by comparing against a baseline model on both synthetic and real datasets. The contribution of this paper lies with 1) a novel opinion dynamics model that emphasize the dependencies between knowledge pieces, 2) proof that the classical DeGroot model is a special case of our model under certain conditions, and, 3) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to try and uncover the mechanism that guides the selection of opinions in the real world by modeling opinion change.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.84", "authors": ["Qi Gu\n,", "Eugene Santos Jr.\n,", "Eunice E.

The limited scope of an enterprise makes it possible to satisfy a high proportion of information needs through completion. Further, the availability of structured sources of completions such as product catalogues compensates for sparsity of log data. Extended forms (X-QAC) can give access to information that is inaccessible via a conventional crawled index.\nWe show that it can be guaranteed that for every suggestion there is a prefix which causes it to appear in the top k suggestions. Using university query logs and structured lists, we quantify the significant keystroke savings attributable to this guarantee (worst case). Such savings may be of particular value for mobile devices. A user experiment showed that a staff lookup task took an average of 61% longer with a conventional search interface than with an X-QAC system.\nUsing wine catalogue data we demonstrate a further extension which allows a user to home in on desired items in faceted-navigation style. We also note that advertisements can be triggered from QAC.\nGiven the advantages and power of X-QAC systems, we envisage that websites and intranets of the [near] future will provide less navigation and rely less on conventional search.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2537734.2537743", "authors": ["David Hawking\n,", "Kathy Griffiths"], "references": ["R.

Given two or more entities, the goal of most algorithms is to produce a graph structure of varying complexity (i.e., a simple path, a minimal weighted tree, or a dense subgraph etc.) as a way of characterizing the relationship between given entities. However, no attention is paid to the interpretability of these results -- i.e., the ability of humans to read these and comprehend the context in which these relationships exist. A key obstacle in this direction is the lack of necessary linguistic context and natural textual result formulations.\nWe pursue the idea of using entity-centric summarization as a way of closing this gap. We aim to turn the resulting graph structures into one or more coherent textual snippets (or summaries) that can be easily read and interpreted. In this short position paper, we first outline two different scenarios that result in slightly different formulations of the problem. Based on preliminary experimental results, we discuss the challenges that are inherent in this setting.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2694476.2694504", "authors": ["Shruti Chhabra\n,", "Srikanta Bedathur"], "references": ["K.

In semantic web area, merging different and often conflicting sources of information, has been recognized as an important problem. Pieces of information to be combined are provided with uncertainty due for instance to the reliability of sources. Possibility theory offers an important tool for representing and reasoning with uncertain, partial and inconsistent pieces of information. This paper first presents possibilistic DL-Lite, denoted by π-DL-Lite as an extension of DL-Lite within a possibility theory setting. It then focuses on the use of a minimum-based (min-based) operator, well known as idem potent conjunctive operator to combine π-DL-Lite possibility distributions and it shows that the semantic fusion of π-DL-Lite possibility distributions has a natural syntactic counterpart when dealing with π-DL-Lite knowledge bases. The min-based fusion operator is recommended when distinct sources that provide information are dependent.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.4", "authors": ["Salem Benferhat\n,", "Zied Bouraoui\n,", "Zied Loukil"], "references": ["Alessandro Artale, Diego Calvanese, Roman Kontchakov, and Michael Zakharyaschev.

We introduce axiomatic and graphical canonical forms for modeling value and cardinality restrictions and Boolean combinations, and present a way of measuring the similarity between these complex concepts in their canonical forms.

Subjectivity of a document strongly depends on its sentences. Hence, a lexical-syntactical approach is proposed to recognize and classify subjectivity at the sentence level. This approach considers the role of various opinion terms especially verbs on opinions regarding social issues. Evaluation of the proposed approach on a data-set consisting comments about abortion shows that it slightly outperforms other similar works. It has a good accuracy especially on the strong sentences which express explicit opinions. Its reasonable F-measure demonstrates a good balance between the precision and recall which makes it suitable for applications such as sentiment polarity classification, text sentiment summarization, and opinion question answering.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.39", "authors": ["Mostafa Karamibekr\n,", "Ali A.

The objective of the coalition formation problem is to determine a partition of the agent set that gives the highest utility to the agents. This problem is non-trivial as the set of partitions that needs to be explored grows exponentially with the number of agents and an exhaustive search in the space of partitions makes the problem intractable. To address this problem, we first provide a formal framework to model the coalition formation problem using a coalition structure graph (CSG). We then propose a branch and bound based algorithm called bottom Up CSG Search that searches for the optimal partitions or coalition structures among the nodes of CSG while pruning nodes that are not going to lead to the optimal coalition structure. We have provided analytical results related to the completeness, anytime-nature and time complexity of our algorithm. We have also verified the performance of our algorithm for a dynamic reformation problem where a set of physical e-puck robots starting from arbitrary positions form sub-teams that maximize their utility. Our experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs better in terms of number of nodes generated and the time required to find the optimal coalition structure or partition than existing CSG-search algorithms.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.128", "authors": ["Ayan Dutta\n,", "Prithviraj Dasgupta\n,", "José Baca\n,", "Carl Nelson"], "references": ["T.

Memory may be allocated thread-locally and shared among multiple threads to study multicore scalability and even false sharing. Memory may be deallocated by threads other than the allocating threads to study blowup memory fragmentation. Memory may be accessed and deallocated sequentially in allocation order or in tree-like traversals to expose allocator deficiencies in exploiting spatial locality.

The conditional dependencies between different named entities across Wikipedia are represented as a Markov network. In our approach, named entities are reated as hidden variables and textual mentions as observations. The number of states and observations is huge and naively using the Viterbi algorithm to find the hidden state sequence that emits the query observation sequence is computationally infeasible, given a state space of this size. Based on an observation that is specific to the disambiguation problem, we propose an approach that uses a tailored approximation to reduce the size of the state space, making the Viterbi algorithm feasible. Results show good improvement in disambiguation accuracy relative to the baseline approach and to some state-of-the-art approaches. Also, our approach shows how, with suitable approximations, HMMs can be used in such large-scale state space problems.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.173", "authors": ["Ayman Alhelbawy\n,", "Robert Gaizauskas"], "references": ["D.

In addition, issues with data processing latency and results depreciating in value with the passage of time, create a need for swifter and more efficient processing. The aim of targeted association mining is to find potentially interesting implications in large repositories of data. Using targeted association mining techniques, specific implications that contain items of user interest can be found faster and before the implications have depreciated in value beyond usefulness. In this paper, the DynTARM algorithm is proposed for the discovery of targeted and rare association rules. DynTARM has the flexibility to discover strong and rare association rules from data streams within the user's sphere of interest. By introducing a measure, called the Volatility Index, to assess the fluctuation in the confidence of rules, rules conforming to different temporal patterns are discovered.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.43", "authors": ["Jennifer Lavergne\n,", "Ryan Benton\n,", "Vijay Raghavan\n,", "Alaaeldin Hafez"], "references": ["R.

Leakage to E is to be confined to well-defined forms of data-access and query patterns while preventing disclosure of explicit data and query plaintext values. Recently, Cash et al. presented a protocol, OXT, which can run arbitrary boolean queries in the SSE setting and which is remarkably efficient even for very large databases.\nIn this paper we investigate a richer setting in which the data owner D outsources its data to a server E but D is now interested to allow clients (third parties) to search the database such that clients learn the information D authorizes them to learn but nothing else while E still does not learn about the data or queried values as in the basic SSE setting. Furthermore, motivated by a wide range of applications, we extend this model and requirements to a setting where, similarly to private information retrieval, the client's queried values need to be hidden also from the data owner D even though the latter still needs to authorize the query. Finally, we consider the scenario in which authorization can be enforced by the data owner D without D learning the policy, a setting that arises in court-issued search warrants.\nWe extend the OXT protocol of Cash et al. to support arbitrary boolean queries in all of the above models while withstanding adversarial non-colluding servers (D and E) and arbitrarily malicious clients, and while preserving the remarkable performance of the protocol.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2508859.2516730", "authors": ["Stanislaw Jarecki\n,", "Charanjit Jutla\n,", "Hugo Krawczyk\n,", "Marcel Rosu\n,", "Michael Steiner"], "references": ["M.

Ubiquitous computing offers many features that are considered compliant to advertising needs. A key aspect in ubiquitous computing is the use of context information to provide information more relevant to users, according to their current situation and environment. This paper introduces CSCoupons, a mobile context-sensitive system to deliver discount coupons. We conduct an experiment with a developed prototype of CSCoupons to assess the ideas about fast food coupons in shopping malls.

Its two basic spatial predicates, INSIDE and WITHIN pairings between points and polygons, can be addressed by state-of-the-art methods such as the crossing number algorithm. In the era of big-data, however, geo-fencing has to process millions of points and hundreds of polygons or even more in real-time. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to improve the scalability of geo-fencing, which consists of two main stages. At the first stage, an R-tree is used to quickly detect whether a point is inside the minimum bounding rectangle of a polygon. In the second stage, instead of an exhaustive search, we design an edge-based locality sensitive hashing scheme adapted to the crossing number algorithm. As for the case of WITHIN detection, a probing scheme is suggested to locate adjacent buckets so as to check all edges near to a target point. By further exploiting batch processing and multi-threading programming, our algorithm can achieve a fast speed while retaining 100% accuracy over all training datasets provided by the GIS Cup 2013 organizers.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2525314.2527264", "authors": ["Yi Yu\n,", "Suhua Tang\n,", "Roger Zimmermann"], "references": ["Axel Kupper, Ulrich Bareth, and Behrend Freese.

The tracking is conducted by third party ad services engaged by the Web sites to facilitate marketing campaigns. Previous research has investigated tracking practices and tracking agencies associated with popular Web sites.

By considering third party domains associated with the top ten search results for a diverse set of queries, we arrived at the networks of third party domains in four search markets. We show a consistent network structure across markets, with a dominant connected component that, on average, includes 92.8% of network vertices and 99.8% of the connecting edges. There is 99.5% chance that a user will become tracked by all top 10 trackers within 30 clicks on search results. Finally, the third party networks exhibit properties of the small world networks.

In this paper, we are trying to find answers to two questions: whether humans possess different attitudes towards other humans and agents, and whether the personality type of a human influences his/her decisions and how. To investigate these problems, first we use the Keirsey Temperament Sorter-II (KTS-II) to discover the personality types of our human participants. Then each participant plays the \"Who Gets More Cake?\" game three times, with a simulated human and an agent as opponents. The experimental results are shown in two aspects: the tendency aspect and the consistency aspect. It is shown that humans treat other humans and agents differently and humans with different KTS-II temperaments behave differently on the above two aspects. It is very possible that the Thinking--Feeling dichotomy of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the tendency results are not independent. Also, there is a correlation between the Extraversion--Introversion dichotomy and the consistency results.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.115", "authors": ["Hongying Du\n,", "Michael N.

In our work we introduce a new reputation model that defines a new aggregation method for users' extracted opinions about products' features from users' text. Our model uses features ontology in order to define general features and sub-features of a product. It also reflects the frequencies of positive and negative opinions.

Conventional resource management scheme would inevitably create a fair amount of spare resource fragments in the system. On the other hand, MapReduce workloads are prone to have a bottleneck stage in the execution pipeline.\nTo address these two issues under a coherent framework, this paper presents Clotho, a MapReduce workload and runtime co-design that can opportunistically utilize the spare resource fragments in the system to alleviate the bottleneck stage of MapReduce workloads while honoring the SLAs of existing systems. We describe the design and the implementation of Clotho, evaluate it with benchmarks drawn from real MapReduce applications, and demonstrate that it can effectively utilize the spare CPU resource fragments and meanwhile improve the performance of user programs if there is potential to speed up the bottleneck stage of the entire MapReduce execution pipeline.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2541583.2541588", "authors": ["Weiming Shi\n,", "Bo Hong"], "references": ["A list of hadoop-powered institutions. http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/PoweredBy.

In such a setting, the agents may need to analyze each other's behavior to make an estimation of the opponent's preferences. This process of opponent modeling makes it possible to find a satisfying negotiation outcome for both parties. A large number of such opponent modeling techniques have already been introduced, together with different measures to assess their quality. The quality of an opponent model can be measured in two different ways: one is to use the agent's performance as a benchmark for the model's quality, the other is to directly evaluate its accuracy by using similarity measures. Both methods have been used extensively, and both have their distinct advantages and drawbacks. In this work we investigate the exact relation between the two, and we pinpoint the measures for accuracy that best predict performance gain. This leads us to new insights in how to construct an opponent model, and what we need to measure when optimizing performance.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.91", "authors": ["Tim Baarslag\n,", "Mark Hendrikx\n,", "Koen Hindriks\n,", "Catholijn Jonker"], "references": ["R.

Users can retrieve information in social media without posting articles and/or comments. Thus, information on the media is regarded as a public good, and media managers must be concerned with the free-riding problem. By installing controllable agents, we analyze the evolution of cooperation in an extended version of the Metanorms Game that describes the communication carried out in specific social media and issues both rewards for cooperation and punishments for noncooperation. From the results of our agent-based simulation, the rewards for cooperation and the rewards for rewards given by others clearly encourage cooperation. Consequently, we clarify that cooperative behaviors are dominant when the benefits of cooperation exceed the costs of rewarding other users. The effects of controllable agents on the evolution of cooperation depend on their types. Whereas the existence of agents who are always cooperating and rewarding cooperators promotes cooperation, agents who are rewarding cooperators without cooperating discourages cooperation. We believe that understanding such mechanisms will be very beneficial when managers make social media policies and decide how to encourage such media.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.162", "authors": ["Fujio Toriumi\n,", "Hitoshi Yamamoto\n,", "Isamu Okada"], "references": ["R.

Facing such a big volume of resources in folksonomy, people need a method of fast exploration and indexing to find their demanded data. To achieve this goal, contextual information is indispensable and valuable to understand user preference and purpose. In sociolinguistics, context can be mainly categorized as verbal context and social context. Comparing with verbal context, social context not only requires domain knowledge to pre-define contextual attributes but also acquires additional data from users. However, there is no research of addressing irrelevant contextual factors for verbal context model so far. The dominating set from verbal context proposed in this paper is to fill this blank. We present the verbal context in folksonomy to capture the user intention, and propose a dominating set discovering method for this verbal context model to prune the irrelevant contextual factors and keep the major characteristics at the same time. Furthermore, the experiments, which are conducted on a public data set, show that the proposed method gives convincing results.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.52", "authors": ["Ting Jin\n,", "Haoran Xie\n,", "Jingsheng Lei\n,", "Qing Li\n,", "Xiaodong Li\n,", "Xudong Mao\n,", "Yanghui Rao"], "references": ["Gediminas Adomavicius, Ramesh Sankaranarayanan, Shahana Sen, and Alexander Tuzhilin.

In particular, we focus on the factor of interpersonal relations among human players, which plays a crucial role in their strategy choosing in real-life games. For such a game, we characterise these relations by a directed and weighted social network, and discuss how to integrate its effect into the payoff matrix of the game. Also, we introduce a solution concept named relation equilibrium for such games. Finally, our model is used to analyse how a deviation will happen in a well-known game, prisoner's dilemma, in the case that the players are networked.

However, such social network data often suffer from severe data sparsity and are not able to provide users with enough information. Therefore, trust prediction has emerged as an important topic in social network research. Traditional approaches are primarily based on exploring trust graph topology itself. However, research in sociology and our life experience suggest that people who are in the same social circle often exhibit similar behaviors and tastes. To take advantage of the ancillary information for trust prediction, the challenge then becomes what to transfer and how to transfer. In this article, we address this problem by aggregating heterogeneous social networks and propose a novel joint social networks mining (JSNM) method. Our new joint learning model explores the user-group-level similarity between correlated graphs and simultaneously learns the individual graph structure; therefore, the shared structures and patterns from multiple social networks can be utilized to enhance the prediction tasks. As a result, we not only improve the trust prediction in the target graph but also facilitate other information retrieval tasks in the auxiliary graphs. To optimize the proposed objective function, we use the alternative technique to break down the objective function into several manageable subproblems. We further introduce the auxiliary function to solve the optimization problems with rigorously proved convergence. The extensive experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real- world data. All empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2541268.2541270", "authors": ["Jin Huang\n,", "Feiping Nie\n,", "Heng Huang\n,", "Yi-Cheng Tu\n,", "Yu Lei"], "references": ["Bedi, P., Kaur, H., and Marwaha, S. 2007.

Such personalisation is required in order to provide an adaptive Web to users, where content fits their preferences, background and current interests, making the Web more social and relevant. Current techniques analyse user activities on social media systems and collect structured or unstructured sets of entities representing users' interests. These sets of entities, or user profiles of interest, are often missing the semantics of the entities in terms of: (i) popularity and temporal dynamics of the interests on the Social Web and (ii) abstractness of the entities in the real world. State of the art techniques to compute these values are using specific knowledge bases or taxonomies and need to analyse the dynamics of the entities over a period of time. Hence, we propose a real-time, computationally inexpensive, domain independent model for concepts of interest composed of: popularity, temporal dynamics and specificity. We describe and evaluate a novel algorithm for computing specificity leveraging the semantics of Linked Data and evaluate the impact of our model on user profiles of interests.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.73", "authors": ["Fabrizio Orlandi\n,", "Pavan Kapanipathi\n,", "Amit Sheth\n,", "Alexandre Passant"], "references": ["F.

Broad appeal of user-uploaded video has been widely confirmed: freely distributed on YouTube, by subscription on Vimeo, and to peers on Facebook/Google+. Unfortunately, user-generated multimedia can be difficult to organize; these services depend on manual \"tagging\" or machine-mineable viewer comments. While manual indexing can be effective for popular, well-established videos, newer content may be poorly searchable; live video need not apply. We envisage video-sharing services for live user video streams, indexed automatically and in realtime, especially by shared content. We propose FOCUS, for Hadoop-on-cloud video-analytics. FOCUS uniquely leverages visual, 3D model reconstruction and multimodal sensing to decipher and continuously track a video's line-of-sight. Through spatial reasoning on the relative geometry of multiple video streams, FOCUS recognizes shared content even when viewed from diverse angles and distances. In a 70-volunteer user study, FOCUS' clustering correctness is roughly comparable to humans.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2517351.2517356", "authors": ["Puneet Jain\n,", "Justin Manweiler\n,", "Arup Acharya\n,", "Kirk Beaty"], "references": ["Crowdoptic. http://www.crowdoptic.com/.", "Exa-tech. http://www.exa-tech.com/.", "Streamweaver. http://streamweaver.com/.", "Stringwire. http://www.stringwire.com/.", "Switchcam. http://www.switchcam.com.", "Vyclone. http://vyclone.com/.", "Yinzcam. http://www.yinzcam.com/.", "S.

In this paper, we consider the problem of finding all the justifications of an entailment in description logic EL+, which underpins OWL 2 EL. Our method for computing all the justifications utilizes the classification result of an EL+ ontology by an OWL EL reasoner. We first give an algorithm for finding all the justifications of an entailment by constructing an explanation dependency graph from the entailment and the classification result. We then propose some pruning strategies to optimize this algorithm. We implement a prototype system by using the multi-core technology. The experimental results show that in many cases, our optimized algorithm outperforms an existing algorithm for finding all the justifications for an entailment in EL+ that is optimized with the module extraction technology.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.31", "authors": ["Zhangquan Zhou\n,", "Guilin Qi\n,", "Boontawee Suntisrivaraporn"], "references": ["F.

By involving both the models and criteria of different disciplines, MDO problems are often too complex to be tackled by classical optimization methods. We propose an approach which takes into account this complexity using a new representation (NDMO - Natural Domain Modeling for Optimization) and a self-adaptive multi-agent algorithm. Our method agentifies the different elements of the problem (such as the variables, the models, the objectives). Each agent is in charge of a small part of the problem and cooperates with others to find equilibrium on conflicting values. Despite the fact that no agent of the system has a complete view of the entire problem, the mechanisms we provide allow the emergence of a coherent solution.

It also supports distributed image search among networked devices while maintaining the same intuitive interface, enabling efficient information sharing among people. We have implemented iScope and conducted infield experiments using networked Nokia N810 portable Internet tablets.

Text classification is one of the crucial technologies for information organisation and management. Text classification has become more and more important and attracted wide attention of researchers from different research fields. In this paper, many feature selection methods, the implement algorithms and applications of text classification are introduced firstly. However, because there are much noise in the knowledge extracted by current data-mining techniques for text classification, it leads to much uncertainty in the process of text classification which is produced from both the knowledge extraction and knowledge usage, therefore, more innovative techniques and methods are needed to improve the performance of text classification. It has been a critical step with great challenge to further improve the process of knowledge extraction and effectively utilization of the extracted knowledge. Rough Set decision making approach is proposed to use Rough Set decision techniques to more precisely classify the textual documents which are difficult to separate by the classic text classification methods. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of existing text classification technologies, to demonstrate the Rough Set concepts and the decision making approach based on Rough Set theory for building more reliable and effective text classification framework with higher precision, to set up an innovative evaluation metric named CEI which is very effective for the performance assessment of the similar research, and to propose a promising research direction for addressing the challenging problems in text classification, text mining and other relative fields.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.190", "authors": ["Libiao Zhang\n,", "Yuefeng Li\n,", "Chao Sun\n,", "Wanvimol Nadee"], "references": ["C.

The present paper models the coordination of charging among EV agents as a Boolean game, where the balancing of the global load is achieved by a principal through the use of environment variables. The iterative Boolean game of charging and avoiding overload is defined and two families of strategies for the principal are proposed. The global goal is to have no overloaded time-slots. Personal goals of agents are composed of their preferred time-slots. To achieve the global goal, the principal informs selected agents of overloaded time-slots through their environment variables. One family of strategies for the principal is shown to always converge to a solution, where the global goal of no overloaded time-slot is achieved. The other family of strategies attempts to achieve the personal goals of all the agents. An experimental evaluation of the two families of strategies on randomly generated EV charging games is presented. The proposed strategies quickly reach a solution that achieves the global goal and a large majority of the agents' personal goals.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.95", "authors": ["Vadim Levit\n,", "Tal Grinshpoun\n,", "Amnon Meisels"], "references": ["P.

Because editors act on their own judgments, editors' biases are reflected in edit actions. When editors' biases are reflected in articles, the articles should have low credibility. However, it is difficult for users to judge which parts in articles have biases. In this paper, we propose a method of clustering editors by editors' biases for the purpose that we distinguish texts' biases by using editors' biases and aid users to judge the credibility of each description. If each text is distinguished such as by colors, users can utilize it for the judgments of the text credibility. Our system makes use of the relationships between editors: agreement and disagreement. We assume that editors leave texts written by editors that they agree with, and delete texts written by editors that they disagree with. In addition, we can consider that editors who agree with each other have similar biases, and editors who disagree with each other have different biases. Hence, the relationships between editors enable to classify editors by biases. In experimental evaluation, we verify that our proposed method is useful in clustering editors by biases. Additionally, we validate that considering the dependency between editors improves the clustering performance.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.50", "authors": ["Akira Nakamura\n,", "Yu Suzuki\n,", "Yoshiharu Ishikawa"], "references": ["Y.

However, most human facial expression is ambiguous or subtle to recognize resulting in poor accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a peak detection method to select only meaningful images from image sequences which imply significant changes of facial expression by calculating differences between images. We believe this method will alleviate the accuracy degradation caused by different personal appearances and ambiguous facial expressions. When applied to commercial products, it can provides a suitable method for adaptation of the empathetic agent embedded in machines such as personal assistants on TV, smartphone and vehicles based on recognized facial expression of users. For experimental validation of the proposed method, we tested four different features for measuring image similarity with the extended Cohn-Kanade facial image dataset. As a result, we could get better recognition accuracy than the original image sequences. Moreover, we reduced the number of images that need to be recognized to 24.52% without degradation of accuracy.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.118", "authors": ["Hyun-Jun Kim\n,", "Young Sang Choi"], "references": ["D.

Personalized geo-social recommendation not only helps users explore new places but also makes LBSNs more prevalent to users. In LBSNs, aside from user preference and social influence, geographical influence has also been intensively exploited in the process of location recommendation based on the fact that geographical proximity significantly affects users' check-in behaviors. Although geographical influence on users should be personalized, current studies only model the geographical influence on all users' check-in behaviors in a universal way. In this paper, we propose a new framework called iGSLR to exploit personalized social and geographical influence on location recommendation. iGSLR uses a kernel density estimation approach to personalize the geographical influence on users' check-in behaviors as individual distributions rather than a universal distribution for all users. Furthermore, user preference, social influence, and personalized geographical influence are integrated into a unified geo-social recommendation framework. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for iGSLR using two large-scale real data sets collected from Foursquare and Gowalla which are two of the most popular LBSNs. Experimental results show that iGSLR provides significantly superior location recommendation compared to other state-of-the-art geo-social recommendation techniques.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2525314.2525339", "authors": ["Jia-Dong Zhang\n,", "Chi-Yin Chow"], "references": ["J.

This problem formulation relegates social connections to being secondary factors. Technology assisted ridesharing applications that put the matching problem first have revealed that they suffer from being unable to address the factor of social comfort, even after adding friend features or piggybacking on social networking sites. This research aims to understand the fabric of social interactions through which ridesharing happens. We take an online observation approach in order to understand the fabric of social interactions for ridesharing that is happening in highly subscribed online groups of local residents. This understanding will help researchers to identify design challenges and opportunities to support ridesharing in local communities.

The previous LLCDM was implemented with MySQL, where various types of application-specific data (e.g., numeric values, text, JSON or XML) were all stored in a column in a schemaless text format. Any query with application-specific data had to be managed by individual applications. It had also a scalability issue as the data size grew.\nTo cope with the limitations, this paper re-engineers the LLCDM with MongoDB NoSQL database. We extensively use the document-oriented semi-strucuted data schema of MongoDB for representing the column. We also re-implement Web-API for the LLCDM which allows queries with both application-specific and neutral attributes.

This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for web pages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing web pages from Delicious database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% ofNDCG10 improvement separately.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.17", "authors": ["Shenghua Liu\n,", "Yatao Zhu\n,", "Jiafeng Guo\n,", "Yuanzhuo Wang\n,", "Xueqi Cheng\n,", "Yue Liu"], "references": ["S.

The stored results typically contain the document summaries and some data that is used to construct the final search result page returned to the user. An alternative strategy is to store in the cache only the result document IDs, which take much less space, allowing results of more queries to be cached. These two strategies lead to an interesting trade-off between the hit rate and the average query response latency. In this work, in order to exploit this trade-off, we propose a hybrid result caching strategy where a dynamic result cache is split into two sections: an HTML cache and a docID cache. Moreover, using a realistic cost model, we evaluate the performance of different result prefetching strategies for the proposed hybrid cache and the baseline HTML-only cache. Finally, we propose a machine learning approach to predict singleton queries, which occur only once in the query stream. We show that when the proposed hybrid result caching strategy is coupled with the singleton query predictor, the hit rate is further improved.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2536777", "authors": ["Rifat Ozcan\n,", "Ismail Sengor Altingovde\n,", "B.

These documents refer domain entities such as persons, places, professional positions, decisions, actions, etc. Querying these documents (instead of browsing, searching and finding) is a very relevant task for any person in general, and particularly for professionals dealing with intensive knowledge tasks. Querying text-based documents' data, however, is not supported by common technology. For that, such documents' content has to be explicitly and formally captured into knowledge base facts. Making use of automatic NLP processes for capturing such facts is a common approach, but their relatively low precision and recall give rise to data quality problems. Further, facts existing in the documents are often insufficient to answer complex queries and, therefore, it is often necessary to enrich the captured facts with facts from third-party repositories (e.g. public LOD, private IS databases). This paper describes the adopted process to identify what data is currently missing from the knowledge base repository and which is desirable to collect from external repositories. The proposed process aims to foster and is driven by OWL DL inference-based instance (ABox) classification, which is supported by the constraints of the TBox.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2539150.2539191", "authors": ["Alda Canito\n,", "Paulo Maio\n,", "Nuno Silva"], "references": ["Canito A., Maio, P. and Silva, N. 2013.

This seems particularly relevant when considering tasks such as speaking in a foreign language, which is known to elicit anxiety. This is even truer for young users for whom negative pedagogical feedbacks might have a strong negative impact on their motivation to learn.\nIn this paper, we consider the approach-avoidance behaviors of teenagers speaking with virtual agents when using an e-learning platform for learning English. We designed an algorithm for processing the video of these teenagers outside laboratory conditions (e.g. a classical collective classroom in a secondary school) using a webcam. This algorithm processes the video of the user and computes the inter-ocular distance. The anxiety of the users is also collected with questionnaires.\nResults show that the inter-ocular distance enables to discriminate between approach and avoidance behaviors of teenagers reacting to positive or negative stimulus. This simple metric collected via video processing enables to detect an approach behavior related to a positive stimulus and an avoidance behavior related to a negative stimulus. Furthermore, we observed that these automatically detected approach-avoidance behaviors are correlated with anxiety.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2522848.2522891", "authors": ["David Antonio Gómez Jáuregui\n,", "Léonor Philip\n,", "Céline Clavel\n,", "Stéphane Padovani\n,", "Mahin Bailly\n,", "Jean-Claude Martin"], "references": ["Alben, L. 1996.

In this context, word-based, sentence-based and graph-based methods approaches are largely used. Among these, graph based methods for automatic text summarization produce summaries based on the relationships between sentences. These relationships may also support the creation of several text processing applications such as extractive and abstractive summaries, question-answering and information retrieval systems, among others. A new graph model for text processing applications is proposed in this paper. It relies on four dimensions (similarity, semantic similarity, co reference, discourse information) to create the graph. The rationale behind the proposal presented here is resorting to more dimensions than previous works, and taking into account co reference resolution, taking into account to the role of pronouns in connecting the sentences. Co reference was not used in any previous graph based summarization technique. An experiment was performed using the Text Rank algorithm with the presented approach, on the CNN corpus. The results show that the model proposed here outperforms the current approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.55", "authors": ["Rafael Ferreira\n,", "Frederico Freitas\n,", "Luciano de Souza Cabral\n,", "Rafael Dueire Lins\n,", "Rinaldo Lima\n,", "Gabriel França\n,", "Steven J.

This year, in CLINSS, focus was on journalistic text reuse between texts written in two different languages. This paper focuses on identifying text reuse between texts written in two different languages-English and Hindi and aims at evaluating the CLINSS dataset by linking 25 target English news stories with top 100 Hindi news stories out of corpora of 50691 stories. This is our first participation at CLINSS task and we have submitted two sets of runs as MANIT-1 and MANIT-2. In MANIT-1 two pre-retrieval strategies 1) Query formed using Proper Noun and 2) Query formed using words whose frequency is equal to or higher than average frequency are used to formulate the query. Query is translated using either dictionary based or machine translation CLIR based approach before retrieving the documents.

Video communication allows a more natural interaction, when aiming to share personal news, ideas, and opinions, by transmitting both verbal content and nonverbal behavior. However, the automatic analysis of natural mood is challenging, since it is displayed in parallel via voice, face, and body. This paper presents an automatic approach to infer 11 natural mood categories in conversational social video using single and multimodal nonverbal cues extracted from video blogs (vlogs) from YouTube. The mood labels used in our work were collected via crowdsourcing. Our approach is promising for several of the studied mood categories. Our study demonstrates that although multimodal features perform better than single channel features, not always all the available channels are needed to accurately discriminate mood in videos.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2541831.2541864", "authors": ["Dairazalia Sanchez-Cortes\n,", "Joan-Isaac Biel\n,", "Shiro Kumano\n,", "Junji Yamato\n,", "Kazuhiro Otsuka\n,", "Daniel Gatica-Perez"], "references": ["Liwc inc. http://www.liwc.net/index.php.", "Merriam-webster online dictionary. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mood.", "Okao vision - omron tech. http://www.omron.com.", "Oxford online dictionary. http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mood.", "N.

The algorithm detects the surrounding areas of interest (AoI) by taking advantage of the underlying structure of quadtrees, considerably saving the number of requests to the LBS server made by the application, thus extending its battery lifetime even in dynamic-speed environments. The areas of interest can have any arbitrary shape and are not constrained to circles as in previous work. In our experiments, through empirical and simulation tests, we show that a substantial reduction of battery consumption can be achieved (up to 45%) while keeping a perfect detection accuracy of areas of interest in comparison with periodic polling techniques widely used in current mobile applications, with error rates of up to 55%.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2534190.2534193", "authors": ["Luis Loyola\n,", "Fernando Wong\n,", "Daniel Pereira\n,", "Horacio Sanson"], "references": ["10gen, Inc.

Snippets, however, are not as useful as they are designed for, which is supposed to assist its users to quickly identify results of interest, if they exist. These snippets fail to (i) provide distinct information and (ii) capture the main contents of the corresponding documents. Moreover, when the intended information need specified in a search query is ambiguous, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for a search engine to identify precisely the set of documents that satisfy the user's intended request without requiring additional inputs. Furthermore, a document title is not always a good indicator of the content of the corresponding document. All of these design problems can be solved by our proposed query-based cluster and labeler, called QCL. QCL generates concise clusters of documents covering various subject areas retrieved in response to a user query, which saves the user's time and effort in searching for specific information of interest without having to browse through the documents one by one. Experimental results show that QCL is effective and efficient in generating high-quality clusters of documents on specific topics with informative labels.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.24", "authors": ["Rani Qumsiyeh\n,", "Yiu-Kai Ng"], "references": ["M.

Effortless content sharing might be the most important application, but we can also use it to provide business card information for attendees, feed information into calendar applications to simplify scheduling of follow-up meetings, populate the membership of collaborative editing applications, mailing lists, and social networks, and perform many other tasks.\nWe have developed a system that uses audio sensing to maintain meeting membership automatically. We choose audio since hearing the same conversation provides a human-centric notion of attending the same gathering. It takes into account walls and other sound barriers between otherwise closely situated people. It can sense participants attending remotely by teleconference. It does not require attendees to perform any explicit action when participants leave a meeting for which they should no longer have access to associated content. It works indoors and outdoors and does not require pre-populating databases with mapping information. For sensors, we require only the commonly available microphones on mobile devices.\nOur system exploits a new technique for matching sensed patterns of relative audio silence, or silence signatures, from mobile devices (mobile phones, tablets, laptops) to determine device co-location. A signature based on simple silence patterns rather than a detailed audio characterization reveals less information about the content of potentially private conversations and is also more robustly compared across devices that are not clock synchronized. We evaluate our method in formal indoor meetings and teleconferences and in ad hoc gatherings outdoors and in a noisy cafeteria. Across all our tests so far, our approach determines audio co-location with a worst-case accuracy of 96%, and recovery from these errors takes only a few seconds. We also describe a content sharing application supported by silence signature matching, the limitations of our approach, current status, and future plans.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2517351.2517362", "authors": ["Wai-Tian Tan\n,", "Mary Baker\n,", "Bowon Lee\n,", "Ramin Samadani"], "references": ["Bump. http://bu.mp/company, November 2012.", "Foursquare. http://foursquare.com, December 2012.", "HP Cloud Services. https://www.hpcloud.com/, December 2012.", "The Carthusian Order: The Carthusian Way. http://www.chartreux.org/en/carthusian-way.php, December 2012.", "A.

Often, records of different types are involved (e.g., authors, publications, institutions, venues), and resolving records of one type can impact the resolution of other types of records. In this paper we propose a flexible, modular resolution framework where existing ER algorithms developed for a given record type can be plugged in and used in concert with other ER algorithms. Our approach also makes it possible to run ER on subsets of similar records at a time, important when the full data are too large to resolve together. We study the scheduling and coordination of the individual ER algorithms, in order to resolve the full dataset, and show the scalability of our approach. We also introduce a \"state-based\" training technique where each ER algorithm is trained for the particular execution context (relative to other types of records) where it will be used.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/s00778-013-0308-z", "authors": ["Steven Euijong Whang\n,", "Hector Garcia-Molina"], "references": ["Aho, A.V., Lam, M.S., Sethi, R., Ullman, J.D.: Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, 2nd edn.

Both techniques bear a significant evaluation overhead, since the analysis can take up to tens of seconds or even minutes per sample.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel, purely static analysis approach, the Delta-system, that (i) extracts change-related features between two versions of the same website, (ii) uses a machine-learning algorithm to derive a model of web site changes, (iii) detects if a change was malicious or benign, (iv) identifies the underlying infection vector campaign based on clustering, and (iv) generates an identifying signature.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the Delta-system by evaluating it on a dataset of over 26 million pairs of web sites by running next to a web crawler for a period of four months. Over this time span, the Delta-system successfully identified previously unknown infection campaigns.

Users are actively connected to these services for creating and sharing contents and events with others, and, in some cases, this activity takes place in the scope of groups of interests. Therefore, from amongst the morass of data generated every day by users, a part of information may match the interests of certain groups. In practice, members are not all linked to each other via each OSN they are connected to. It is also not realistic to assume that each member can manually explore all others' social profiles to reach the information that may be relevant to their interests. Thus, there is a need for aggregating members' social streams on a single information support to collect relevant information, and, consequently, to promote collaborative knowledge-sharing. However, the disconnected nature of today social websites prevents a straightforward aggregation process. An efficient automated aggregation model is needed. We present, in this paper, the idea of empowering collaborative intelligence by the use of a user-centered approach for OSN aggregation. We illustrate the approach by a first experience to evaluate its impact on users information sharing and enrichment capabilities.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.60", "authors": ["Xuan Truong Vu\n,", "Pierre Morizet-Mahoudeaux\n,", "Marie-Hélène Abel"], "references": ["W.

Early database models such as the Relational Model used schemas to express semantics and implicitly aimed at achieving interoperability by providing programming independence of data storage and access.\nAfter a number of intermediate steps such as Object Oriented Data Bases and Semi - Structured Data such as hypertext and XML document models, the notions of semantics and interoperability became what they have been over the last ten years in the context of the World Wide Web and more recently the concept of Open Linked Data.\nWith this talk we investigate semantics and interoperability research from the point of view of information systems.

Current approach predicts the matching of an SMS and FAQs more accurately as compared to our previous solution for this task which was submitted in FIRE 2011. We provide solution for SMS and FAQs matching in Malayalam language (an Indian language) in addition to Hindi and English this time. In order to perform a matching between SMS queries and FAQ database, we introduce enhanced similarity score, proximity score, enhanced length score and an answer matching system. We introduce the stemming of terms and consider the effects of joining adjacent terms in SMS query and FAQ to improve the similarity score. We propose a novel method to normalize FAQ and SMS tokens to improve the accuracy for Hindi language. Moreover, we suggest a few character substitutions to handle error in the SMS query. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by considering many real-life FAQ-datasets provided by FIRE from a number of different domains such as Health, Telecom, Insurance and Railway booking. Experimental results confirm that our solution for the SMS-based FAQ Retrieval monolingual task is very encouraging and among the top submissions which performed very well for English, Hindi and Malayalam. The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) scores for our approach are 0.971, 0.973 and 0.761 respectively for English, Hindi and Malayalam SMS-based FAQ Retrieval monolingual task in FIRE 2012. Furthermore, our solution topped the task for Hindi language with MRR score equal to 0.971 in FIRE 2013. Our approach performs very well for English language as well in FIRE 2013 despite transcripts of the speech queries are included in test dataset along with the normal SMS queries.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2701336.2701642", "authors": ["Anwar Dilawar Shaikh\n,", "Rajiv Ratn Shah\n,", "Rahis Shaikh"], "references": ["R.

The idea of the core can be extended to such a case. In this paper, we propose an innovative algorithm called CoreD to check core-non-emptiness for coalition structures. A more straightforward algorithm based on existing techniques, which we call CoreP, first obtains the value of optimal coalition structure by solving an integer programming problem. Then, it checks whether that value can be divided without making a blocking (dissatisfied) coalition. In contrast, CoreD first finds a minimal amount value of optimal coalition structure so that there exists no blocking coalition. Then, it checks whether the optimal value can be equal to the minimal value. We empirically show that when the core is empty, CoreD is by far superior to CoreP. Also, to find a second-best payoff vector when the core is empty, we propose a new solution concept called the weak ∊-core+, which can utilize the approximate value of the optimal coalition structure. Based on the idea of CoreD, we further develop an algorithm for checking the non-emptiness of the weak ∊-core+.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.99", "authors": ["Atsushi Iwasaki\n,", "Suguru Ueda\n,", "Makoto Yokoo"], "references": ["G.

In possibilistic DLs, a crucial reasoning task is to compute the inconsistency degree of a possibilistic DL knowledge base. In this work, we first point out a shortcoming of a previous tableaux algorithm for possibilistic DL ALC and propose a new tableaux algorithm. We then propose a tableaux algorithm for computing the inconsistency degree of a knowledge base in possibilistic DL ALCIR+, which extends possibilistic DL ALC with inverse roles and transitive roles. A blocking condition is proposed to ensure the termination of the algorithm. Although the tableaux algorithm for possibilistic DL ALCIR+ is easy to understand and to implement, it may need exponential space in the worst case. Therefore, we give another tableaux algorithm to improve it and show that the complexity of this algorithm is PSpace-complete.

However it is limited in some issues and has serious drawbacks if it is applied in such real world applications where temporal interaction aspects are of great importance and fault-tolerance is a crucial issue. Many researchers have proposed various methods to expand and to improve it but those challenges have not been much addressed. To cope with these limitations, this paper proposes a formal model that extends the conventional contract net with real time constraints, often defined as interaction duration and message deadlines, and fault tolerance to handle the agent death exception. In this study we concentrate on the reliability of the awarded contractor which may die while carrying out the assigned task. In the proposed approach a timeout mechanism is modeled to detect the crash failure of the contractor, hence a proper termination of the negotiation process can be timely performed by the manager ensuring the failure recovery. We model the extended CNP with timed colored Petri nets and show that it terminates correctly either in a safety case or in a failure situation. The model analysis by means of CPN tools proves that the protocol meets the key properties namely model correctness, deadline respect, absence of deadlocks and live locks, absence of dead code, agent terminal states consistency, concurrency and validity.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.85", "authors": ["Djamila Boukredera\n,", "Ramdane Maamri\n,", "Samir Aknine"], "references": ["D.

In our prior work, we demonstrated that by using these topologies and letting applications implement custom routing protocols and perform operations on path, it is possible to increase performance and simplify development. However, these benefits cannot be achieved using mainstream point-to-point networking stacks such as TCP/IP or MPI, which hide the underlying topology and do not allow the implementation of any in-network operations.\nIn this paper we describe CamCubeOS, a novel key-based communication stack, purposely designed from scratch for 3D torus fabric interconnects. We note that many of the applications used in clusters are key-based. Therefore, we designed CamCubeOS to natively support key-based operations. We select a virtual topology that perfectly matches the underlying physical topology and we use the keyspace to expose the physical locality, thus avoiding the typical overhead incurred by overlay-based approaches.\nWe report on our experience in building several applications on top of CamCubeOS and we evaluate their performance and feasibility using a prototype and large-scale simulations.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2462902.2462917", "authors": ["Paolo Costa\n,", "Austin Donnelly\n,", "Greg O'Shea\n,", "Antony Rowstron"], "references": ["Abu-Libdeh, H., Costa, P., Rowstron, A., O'Shea, G., and Donnelly, A.

The game defined here is that decision-makers can choose some lotteries sequentially. The sequential choice means that they can select the next lottery by using outcomes of all the previous lotteries they chose. The number of types of lotteries are two, with the same expected payoff but different degree of risk. We modeled it mathematically strictly and analyzed some features with two approaches: multi agent model and theoretical analysis. According to the analyses, we observed that relative high-risk behaviors, which is not the highest, easily survive. Further, more risky strategies are most adaptive when mutants always can invade. Such insights not only correspond to human behavior described by the prospect theory, but also make it possible to explain a rational mechanism which cannot be explained by this theory.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.166", "authors": ["Isamu Okada\n,", "Hitoshi Yamamoto"], "references": ["Arnold, V.I., Ordinary Differential Equations, MIT Press, 1973.", "Brown, G.W. and von Neumann, J., Solutions of games by differential equations, Ann.

With the onset of exascale computing, the increasing gap between compute performance and I/O bandwidth has rendered the traditional method of post-simulation processing a tedious process. Despite the challenges due to increased data production, there exists an opportunity to benefit from \"cheap\" computing power to perform query-driven exploration and visualization during simulation time. To accelerate such analyses, applications traditionally augment raw data with large indexes, post-simulation, which are then repeatedly utilized for data exploration. However, the generation of current state-of-the-art indexes involve a compute- and memory-intensive processing, thus rendering them inapplicable in an in situ context. In this paper we propose DIRAQ, a parallel in situ, in network data encoding and reorganization technique that enables the transformation of simulation output into a query-efficient form, with negligible runtime overhead to the simulation run. DIRAQ begins with an effective core-local, precision-based encoding approach, which incorporates an embedded compressed index that is 3 -- 6x smaller than current state-of-the-art indexing schemes. DIRAQ then applies an in network index merging strategy, enabling the creation of aggregated indexes ideally suited for spatial-context querying that speed up query responses by up to 10x versus alternative techniques. We also employ a novel aggregation strategy that is topology-, data-, and memory-aware, resulting in efficient I/O and yielding overall end-to-end encoding and I/O time that is less than that required to write the raw data with MPI collective I/O.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2462902.2465527", "authors": ["Sriram Lakshminarasimhan\n,", "David A.

A fast static index pruning algorithm is presented, which is a term-centric method and adopts BM25 weighting as the pruning measure. The algorithm scans through documents set with one pass and directly builds pruned index, and therefore avoids the construction of original index. The correctness of the algorithm is proved and the theoretical analysis reveals that its IO performance takes precedence over other algorithms. The experiments based on TREC data set also show that the fast static index pruning algorithm requires less time to build pruned index, and the pruning effectiveness outperforms the baseline method.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556871.2556878", "authors": ["Xiaofeng Liu"], "references": ["Justin Zobel and Alistair Moffat.

This expansion is usually performed by the development of software involving all heterogeneous and autonomous partners. The user requirement collection and analysis is one of the most important phase of the life cycle of software development. In the context of globalization, this phase becomes a challenging issue. This is because designers of each branch of a given global company may use different vocabulary and formalism to express their requirements. Solutions exist in the literature to unify either vocabularies or formalisms, but not both. In this paper, we propose a semantic and scalable approach that unifies the vocabularies and formalisms by the means of ontologies. The capabilities of reasoning offered by ontologies is exploited to identify the inconsistencies in an efficient way. Our approach is validated by a case tool using three formalisms: the UML use case, the goal oriented and the treatment conceptual model of Merise method.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2539150.2539263", "authors": ["Ilyès Boukhari\n,", "Ladjel Bellatreche\n,", "Selma Khouri"], "references": ["E.

Recommender systems that exploit user feedback are widely used in e-commerce and quite necessary for business enhancement. To make use of such user feedback, we propose a new content/collaborative hybrid approach, which is built on top of the recently released hetrec2011-movielens-2k dataset and is an extension of a previously proposed neighborhood based approach, called Weighted Tag Recommender (WTR). Our approach has two versions. Both versions make use of ratings to enable collaborative filtering and use either user tags, available in the hetrec2011-movielens-2k dataset, or movie keywords retrieved from IMDB, to capture movie content information. Experimental results show that the information from keywords can help build a movie recommender system competitive with other neighborhood based approaches and even with more sophisticated state-of-the-art approaches.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.11", "authors": ["Ana Stanescu\n,", "Swapnil Nagar\n,", "Doina Caragea"], "references": ["G.

While most existing work focuses on the expected number of users influenced, the detailed probability distribution of users influenced is also significant. However, determining the probability distribution of the final influence propagation state is difficult. Monte-Carlo simulations may be used, but are computationally expensive. In this paper, we develop an analytical model for the influence propagation process in online social networks based on discrete-time Markov chains, and deduce a closed-form equation for the n-step transition probability matrix. We show that given any initial state, the probability distribution of the final influence propagation state may be easily obtained from a matrix product. This provides a powerful tool to further understand social influence propagation.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.2", "authors": ["Xiaoguang Fan\n,", "Guolin Niu\n,", "Victor O.

This paper describes a collaborative black-box method, and an implementation called Carat, for diagnosing anomalies on mobile devices. A client app sends intermittent, coarse-grained measurements to a server, which correlates higher expected energy use with client properties like the running apps, device model, and operating system. The analysis quantifies the error and confidence associated with a diagnosis, suggests actions the user could take to improve battery life, and projects the amount of improvement. During a deployment to a community of more than 500,000 devices, Carat diagnosed thousands of energy anomalies in the wild. Carat detected all synthetically injected anomalies, produced no known instances of false positives, projected the battery impact of anomalies with 95% accuracy, and, on average, increased a user's battery life by 11% after 10 days (compared with 1.9% for the control group).", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2517351.2517354", "authors": ["Adam J.

In this paper, we present a highly efficient network-aware caching and prefetching mechanism tailored to reduce metadata access latency and improve responsiveness in wide-area data transfers. To improve the maximum requests per second (RPS) handled by the system, we designed and implemented a network-aware prefetching service using dynamically provisioned parallel TCP streams. To improve the performance of accessing local metadata, we designed and implemented a non-blocking concurrent in-memory cache to handle unexpected bursts of requests. We have implemented the proposed mechanisms in the Directory Listing Service (DLS) system---a Cloud-hosted metadata retrieval, caching, and prefetching system, and have evaluated its performance on Amazon EC2 and XSEDE.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2534695.2534700", "authors": ["Bing Zhang\n,", "Brandon Ross\n,", "Sanatkumar Tripathi\n,", "Sonali Batra\n,", "Tevfik Kosar"], "references": ["Http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/tuning.html.", "Enhancing the Performance of OpenLDAP Directory Server with Multiple Caching.", "Cluster file system, inc. lustre: A scalable, high performance file system. http://www.Lustre.org/docs.html.", "Allen, B., Bresnahan, J., Childers, L., Foster, I., Kandaswamy, G., Kettimuthu, R., Kordas, J., Link, M., Martin, S., Pickett, K., and Tuecke, S.

The resulting contours drive the parametrization of a structural head-related transfer function model that performs in real time the spatialization of a desired sound file according to the listener's position with respect to the virtual sound source, tracked by sensor-equipped headphones.

We formulate the problem of adaptation as iterative substitution of appropriate components in a composition, and provide two algorithms that produce a sequence of increasingly preferred adaptations with time: a fast algorithm that searches for preferred adaptations by improving the valuation of the relatively more important attributes, and another that is computationally more intensive but guaranteed to produce at least one preferred adaptation, if one exists.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.68", "authors": ["Ganesh Ram Santhanam\n,", "Samik Basu\n,", "Vasant Honavar"], "references": ["M.

User profiling can be seen as the inference of user interests, intentions, characteristics, behaviors and preferences. This paper introduces a scalable and automated technique for user profiling by extracting his URLs from publicly available tweets information and using a semantic ontology in which user interests and intentions are characterized. In order to enhance the performance of our method, categorization of websites offered by OpenDNS and DBpedia collective knowledge databases are used to find the interests and intention categories of the user profile ontology. In this context, user profile ontology is populated taking these collective categories and with assertions of individuals, and relationships of interest and intention. As new concepts and relationships are defined and inferred, user profile ontology evolves continuously. Experimental results based on user's tweets confirm strongly that the proposed method improves the automatic acquisition of interests and intentions of a user profile.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.62", "authors": ["Paula Peñas\n,", "Rafael del Hoyo\n,", "Jorge Vea-Murguía\n,", "Carlos González\n,", "Sergio Mayo"], "references": ["Malhotra, A., Totti, L., Meira Jr., W., Kumaraguru, P. & Almeida, V. \"Studying user footprints in different online social networks\". 2012 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, pp.1065-1070 (2012).", "Tao, X., Li, Y., Lau, R.

This paper proposes an approach to evaluate the performance of web application system throughout the developing process. The approach consists of three Java models: workload, simulation and performance analyzer. Workload model aims to mimic a set of real users accessing the web application system. While the second model intentions to log performance measurements of web application system through simulation, the performance measurements are evaluated by the last model. For this work, average response time, total number http of requests and throughput are considered for web application performance metrics. The related experiment results are compared with actual hosted system and found that they are close with an average variant of 7.8% from the real performance measurements.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2539150.2539264", "authors": ["Tahani Hussain"], "references": ["JAVA.

It must fulfill several cryptographic properties such as high nonlinearity, low differential uniformity and complex algebraic expression to resist against linear, differential and interpolation attacks. In this paper, we extend and improve the s-box construction method proposed by Mamadolimov et al. [26, 27] which construct an s-box from power and binomial functions over the finite field F28. We study the cryptographic properties exhibited from our s-box and do a comparative analysis with several known 8X8 bijective s-boxes. Our analysis shows that our proposed s-box is ranked seventh compared to known 8X8 bijective s-boxes in terms of strong cryptographic properties. It even surpasses some known s-boxes used in popular block ciphers.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2523514.2523525", "authors": ["Herman Isa\n,", "Norziana Jamil\n,", "Muhammad Reza Z'aba"], "references": ["Aoki, K., Ichikawa, T., Kanda, M., Matsui, M., Moriai, S., Nakajima, J., and Tokita, T.

An uneven energy distribution in a swarm of robots performing a mission may prevent completion of the group's mission or reduce its tolerance for adverse events that occur during mission execution. The goal of effectively managing energy use in a swarm is known as collective energy homeostasis. While previous works have mainly focused on achieving this goal by direct energy exchange methods (e.g., using battery charging mechanisms), this paper presents a novel bio-inspired approach for maintaining collective energy homeostasis in social robot swarms. The approach extends Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques for task selection and motion planning for individual robots by making them sensitive to the robot's energy state. The overall effect of this Energy-based PSO (EPSO) algorithm is to shift energy-intensive tasks towards robots in the swarm that have higher energy levels, i.e. energy load-leveling, which improves energy self-sufficiency and its homogeneity across the swarm. This can be considered a form of indirect energy exchange by task shifting. Experimental results show that the EPSO algorithm enables social robot swarms to maintain collective energy homeostasis more effectively than previous approaches, reducing the variance of energy between individuals by 49%, and extending the number of missions that a swarm can achieve, given a fixed initial energy budget.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.87", "authors": ["Xin Zhou\n,", "David Kinny"], "references": ["A.

The rate that the number of objects is increasing has now outpaced our ability to build additional sites and there is an increasing concern for the safety of our astronauts and other space-borne assets. Another solution is to use large numbers of low-cost optical sensors, which can be easily deployed at a fraction of the cost of a traditional tracking station. However, the introduction of these systems, which are subject to time and position constraints, creates a complex coordination problem that must be solved in a communication limited environment. In this paper, we describe the satellite tracking problem and compare a resource allocation and scheduling representation for the problem. As an initial solution, scheduling tasks to telescope-slot pairs by a central facility is adopted. Then, we compare central and distributed repair mechanisms in terms of tasks completed and the communication cost.

In Poker, these issues are commonly addressed by estimating opponents' game play using a variety of techniques such as Expected Hand Strength (E[HS]) or Hand Potential. In this paper, we propose criteria which can be applied when assessing such techniques, and we have also run benchmark tests which demonstrate their pertinence. We have, however, been faced with a clear gap in terms of the methods' efficiency. While this is not a problem in theoretical models, when implementing such methods in real world applications, they can prove to be painfully slow. In order to address this issue, we propose the Average Rank Strength (ARS) method. It can calculate the strength of a hand of any size through the hand's rank width negligible error, when compared to the original method. Still, the greatest contribution of this method lies in the speed-up factor of about 1000 times over E[HS]. Since most successful agents in the literature use their game abstraction based on E[HS], this breakthrough will significantly contribute towards a much lighter strategy computation, since this routine must be called billions of times. By saving computation time, we believe that future integration of ARS with current game playing algorithms will allow for creating agents with smaller abstraction levels, thus making room for improvement in their overall performance.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.134", "authors": ["Luís Filipe Teófilo\n,", "Luís Paulo Reis\n,", "Henrique Lopes Cardoso"], "references": ["M.

Firstly, a new ETL process for textual data, named ETL-Text, is defined, secondly, a multidimensional text warehouse model, denoted TWM, is designed, and finally, OLAP processing component, named Text-OLAP, is deployed. The proposed TWM model is associated with new dimension types including a meta-data dimension and a semantic dimension. It includes also a new attribute measure based on the language model widely used in information retrieval (IR) area. To validate our approach, we develop a prototype composed of several modules that illustrate the phases of the decisional architecture.

Manual indexing is unfeasible for large video collections. Video combines different types of data from different modalities. Using information from multiple modalities may result in a more robust and accurate video retrieval. Therefore, effective indexing for video retrieval requires a multimodal approach in which either the most appropriate modality is selected or the different modalities are used in collaborative fashion. This paper presents a new metric access method -- Slim2-tree -- which combines information from multiple modalities within a single index structure for video retrieval. Experimental studies on a large real dataset show the video similarity search performance of the proposed technique. Additionally, we present experiments comparing our method against state-of-the-art of multimodal solutions. Comparative test results demonstrate that our technique improves the performance of video similarity queries.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2526188.2526204", "authors": ["Ricardo C.

FOCUS is a video-clustering service for live user video streams, indexed automatically and in realtime by shared content. FOCUS uniquely leverages visual, 3D model reconstruction and multimodal sensing to decipher and continuously track a video's line-of-sight. Through spatial reasoning on the relative geometry of multiple video streams, FOCUS recognizes shared content even when viewed from diverse angles and distances. We believe FOCUS can enable a new family of applications, such as instant replay, augmented reality, citizen journalism, security breach detection, and disaster assessment.\nIn the demonstration, we will show 325 video clips taken at Duke University Wallace Wade Stadium being processed in real-time via FOCUS pipeline. The recorded video clips contain one of three spots in the stadium: East Stand, Scoreboard, and West Stand. The demo shall be shown in the form of a web interface, first showing randomly clustered video clips. Later, on a button click, FOCUS shall process displayed videos in real-time, outputting clusters of videos, containing the common shared subject in each of them. For each successfully processed video clip in a cluster, we will further show similar clips from near, medium, and wide angle. To display performance and accuracy of FOCUS in indoor environments, a similar demonstration will be shown for an office space.

Yet the behavior the application exhibits may change over time and depend on the actual execution scenario: particular inputs and program settings, the number of processes used, or hardware-specific problems. So beyond the details of a single experiment a far more interesting question arises: how does the application behavior respond to changes in the execution conditions?\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that object tracking concepts from computer vision have huge potential to be applied in the context of performance analysis. We leverage tracking techniques to analyze how the behavior of a parallel application evolves through multiple scenarios where the execution conditions change.

Dejavu employs a dead-reckoning localization approach and leverages these road landmarks, among other automatically discovered abundant virtual landmarks, to reset the accumulated error and achieve accurate localization. To maintain a low energy profile, Dejavu uses only energy-efficient sensors or sensors that are already running for other purposes.\nWe present the design of Dejavu and how it leverages crowd-sourcing to automatically learn virtual landmarks and their locations. Our evaluation results from implementation on different android devices in both city and highway driving show that Dejavu can localize cell phones to within 8.4 m median error in city roads and 16.6 m on highways. Moreover, compared to GPS and other state-of-the-art systems, Dejavu can extend the battery lifetime by 347%, achieving even better localization results than GPS in the more challenging in-city driving conditions.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2525314.2525338", "authors": ["Heba Aly\n,", "Moustafa Youssef"], "references": ["M.

It was in this context that in 2004 the Online Knowledge Library (b-on) was launched in Portugal. With it, it became easier to get access to full text international scientific publications. This study aims to present and analyze some bibliometric indicators of the Portuguese scientific output seeking to evaluate its link it with b-on. It was analyzed the usage of b-on resources by the public universities members of the consortium from 2004 to 2010, and we chose as sample the five universities with more downloads per FTE (full time equivalent).In addition to the usage data of the consortium, we used the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus from which we identified the articles indexed with Portuguese affiliation and by the five Portuguese universities between 2000--2010. In WoS we found 79.192 articles indexed with at least one Portuguese author, published in the years under analysis, 40.413 have affiliation at least in one of the five universities considered in this study (51%). In Scopus the number of articles is similar, 62.634 articles for Portugal from which 33.417 have affiliation in at least one of the five universities (54%).We identified the research areas with the largest number of articles. The national scientific production concerning the scientific areas is relatively diverse in accordance with both databases: Chemistry, Physics Engineering, Materials Sciences and Biochemistry Molecular Biology are the subject areas with more indexed articles in WoS; Medicine, Engineering, Physics and Astronomy, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology and Chemistry in Scopus. The same article can have multiple authors, with different institutional affiliations from different nationalities. The Portuguese international co-authorship is growing in the recent years, mainly with the USA, Spain and United Kingdom.

These reviews give developers feedback on their own apps, as well as help provide data for competitor analysis. However, given the size of the data set, manual analysis of reviews is unrealistic, especially given the need for a rapid response to changing market dynamics. Current research into mobile app reviews has provided an insight into the statistical distributions, but there is minimal knowledge about the content in these reviews. In particular, we do not know if the aggregated numerical rating is a reliable indicator of the information within a review. This work reports on an analysis of reviews to determine how closely aligned the numerical ratings are to the textual description. We observed that short user reviews mostly contain a small set of words, and the corresponding numerical rating matches the underlying sentiment.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2541016.2541067", "authors": ["Leonard Hoon\n,", "Rajesh Vasa\n,", "Gloria Yoanita Martino\n,", "Jean-Guy Schneider\n,", "Kon Mouzakis"], "references": ["Chen, H.-N., and Huang, C.-Y.

Recently, a method for modeling and execution of business processes, named subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM), gained attention. This methodology facilitates modeling of any business process using only five symbols and allows direct execution based on such models. Any process is defined as a network of independent and distributed agents which coordinate work through the exchange of messages. In this work, we present a framework and a prototype based on off-the-shelf technologies as a general execution platform for S-BPM process models and we can prove and demonstrate the principal architecture concept.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.154", "authors": ["Stefan Raβ\n,", "Johannes Kotremba\n,", "Robert Singer"], "references": ["H.

When the mobile devices are offline, such applications become less accessible to users. A cache-based method is proposed to improve the offline accessibility for mobile location-based applications. The central idea is that when users are browsing information, the client program not only submits the current query window to the server, but also attempts to predict the most likely (from a probabilistic standpoint) query windows that would be submitted to the server in the future. The major challenge is the very large number of possible future query windows. This challenge is tackled by proposing a discretization technique that makes predictions over a finite subset of all possible query windows. A probabilistic model is proposed for prediction, which is trained using the query log recorded by the client, so that the prediction can be executed entirely on the client side. The advantage of this technique is that it requires no modification on the existing server side, so it can be adapted by most existing applications easily. The usability of the technique is demonstrated by prototyping it on top the NewsStand system so that the query window is constantly changing as users pan and zoom around the world using a gesturing interface, among others. Evaluation shows the prototype to be effective while decreasing the response time.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2525314.2525366", "authors": ["Chang Liu\n,", "Brendan C.

In attachment theory the attachment figures is the base from which the individual interacts with the environment, explores the world and copes with distress. We claim that a socio-emotional lasting relation with a system as an attachment figure is a necessary prerequisite for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems to be accepted by users as support in daily care. We observe that most AAL systems lack such an approach. Four scales that measure the quality of attachment are suggested to be used to evaluate AAL systems. We address a variety of components that are required to make a successful attachment between the system and the user for persons that are in need of care. As a basis for the attachment the theory of Ainsworth [1] is used. These factors builds a socio-emotional relationship with the user and help in maintaining or increasing the well being of the user. This socioemotional relationship can be an important explanation for the successfulness of an ambient assisting system in the healthcare domain.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.180", "authors": ["Peter H.

We propose a verification technique that investigates such MASs by means of guided simulations. This is achieved by modeling the evolutions of an MAS as a transition system (implicitly), and the property to be verified as another transition system (explicitly). The former is derived (on-the-fly) from a formal specification of the MAS's environment. The latter, which we call a simulation purpose, is used both to verify the property and to guide the simulation. In this way, only the states that are relevant for the property in question are actually simulated. Algorithmically, this corresponds to building a synchronous product of these two transitions systems on-the-fly and using it to operate a simulator. This paper presents an overall account of this approach, whose several parts were developed in a number of previous works. Our main objective here is to provide an overall account of the technique in a succinct manner, so that its most important and general features are highlighted.

A number of studies have been conducted to try to understand the conditions or mechanisms that create and keep social media thriving using a public goods game and/or meta-rewards games, in which situations where many users post articles and respond to them as reactions in social media correspond to situations where cooperation is dominant in these games. However, they assume that agent networks in social media are complete graphs that are known to be dissimilar to actual social networks. We examined the conditions required to keep agent networks thriving based on Watts and Strogatz (WS) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) models, which are more similar to actual social networks. We experimentally found similarities and differences in the conditions for cooperation-dominant situations between networks based on complete graphs and those based on WS and BA models.

The MOWL definition of Spatio-Temporal relations is extended to represent the Context of an event. The Context is any kind of information which gets defined with respect to an event instance wherein Context has its own structure and involves parameters like Time, Geographical location, and Actors/ Entities involved in the event. Such an extension would enhance event detection and facilitate complete semantics, besides providing scope for personalized multimedia information retrieval.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.176", "authors": ["Nisha Pahal\n,", "Santanu Chaudhury\n,", "Brejesh Lall"], "references": ["A.

Some are beneficial and comment on several aspects of a user's real life, i.e., eating, traffic, weather, disasters, and so on. Such posts as \"The train is not coming!\" are categorized in the \"Traffic\" aspect and will support users who want to ride the train. Such tweets as \"The train is not coming due to heavy rain\" are categorized in both the \"Traffic\" and \"Weather\" aspects. In this paper, we propose a multi-label method that estimates appropriate aspects against unknown tweets by extending the two phase extraction method. In it, many topics are extracted from a sea of tweets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Associations among many topics and fewer aspects are built using a small set of labeled tweets. Aspect scores for unknown tweets are calculated using the associations among the topics and the aspects based on the extracted terms. Appropriate aspects are labeled for unknown tweets by averaging of the aspect scores. Using a large amount of actual tweets, our sophisticated experimental evaluations demonstrate the high efficiency of our proposed multi-label classification method. When an aspect score is much larger than others, that aspect is estimated against the tweet. When several aspect scores are large within similar values, these aspects are estimated. Based on the experimental evaluation results, our prototype system demonstrates that our proposed method can appropriately estimate some aspects of each unknown tweets.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2539150.2539197", "authors": ["Shuhei Yamamoto\n,", "Tetsuji Satoh"], "references": ["D.

However, most of them do not take into account additional contextual information that may affect user preferences, such as place, time, or weather. Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) have been proposed to solve this problem by providing recommendations for users based on their rating history in different situations. Although most have tried to identify the contextual variables that have the greatest effect on rating accuracy, they have not directly considered the relationships among context, users, and items before predicting the ratings. In the real world, different contextual factors tend to affect users and items differently. This work proposes a latent probabilistic model for contextual recommendation by extending the flexible mixture model to incorporate different contextual factors. This model has the flexibility to adjust the effects of contextual factors on users and items according to a variety of context-user-item relations to suit specific situations. Our evaluation has shown that the proposed model's recommendations are more accurate than those made by both latent probabilistic models and collaborative filtering-based CARS.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.14", "authors": ["Padipat Sitkrongwong\n,", "Saranya Maneeroj\n,", "Atsuhiro Takasu"], "references": ["G.

The objective is to better predict activities involved in documents by considering general topics of the activities for clustering. The proposed model is a supervised topic model based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). As a follow-up study of word-pair generation LDA (wpLDA) model, the model introduces the topic-specific activity distribution as an external input, with an activity node inserted into the main generation thread. In addition, we refer to D. Ramage et al.'s one-to-one correspondence to directly learn word-activity tags. An experiment was conducted to prove the feasibility of this model. We chose ten top-listed activities from the wish clusters obtained by the previous wpLDA research, and used each as the key words to extract thirty tweets for training and five for testing, respectively, tagging the tweets with the corresponding activities. By applying the proposed model, we obtained the expected tri-layer clusters in the training phase. Then, in the testing phase, we utilized the activity-specific word distribution derived from the training results to learn the activities of the testing documents. The Stanford Classifier was put forward as the control group, and the activity prediction accuracy demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits the superiority in multi-activity prediction.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.51", "authors": ["Dandan Zhu\n,", "Yusuke Fukazawa\n,", "Jun Ota"], "references": ["M.

Motivated by the randomness and fuzziness of user trust relationships at the web age, this paper proposes a novel user trust relationship prediction method based on cloud model. We start by defining trust cloud, distrust cloud and scoring cloud; then calculate expectation, entropy and hyper-entropy to extract digital characteristics of cloud by utilizing inverse cloud generation algorithm; and finally predict user trust relationships based on trust distance and distrust distance. To analyze the effect of the proposed approach, we conducted experiment on the Extended Epinions dataset, which shows that the precision, recall and F-measure of our method reaches 96.94%, 99.14% and 98.03% respectively, with an increase of 0.21%, 13.11%, and 9.01% over current best method, demonstrating that predicting user trust relations in social networks based on cloud model is reasonable and effective.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556871.2556903", "authors": ["Qian Zhang\n,", "Tianyi Zhang\n,", "Xianglin Zuo\n,", "Yuan Yao\n,", "Baoping Feng\n,", "Junhua Wang\n,", "Wanli Zuo"], "references": ["Ashri, R., Ramchurn, S.D., Sabater, Luck,J.

However, traditional garbage collection is approaching both practical and theoretical performance limits. In practice, the maximum heap size and heap structure of large applications are influenced as much by garbage collector behavior as by resource availability.\nWe present an alternate approach to garbage collection wherein the programmer provides untrusted deallocation hints. Usage of deallocation hints is similar to trusted manual deallocation, but the consequence of an inaccurate hint is lost performance not correctness. Our hinted collector algorithm uses these hints to identify a subset of unreachable objects with both better parallel asymptotic complexity and practical performance. On some benchmarks, our prototype collector implementation achieves 10-20% pause time reductions. We close with a discussion of the design trade-offs inherent in our approach and lessons to be learned from our collector.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2464157.2464158", "authors": ["Philip Reames\n,", "George Necula"], "references": ["TIOBE Programming Community Index for January 2013. http://www.tiobe.com/content/paperinfo/tpci/.\\Accessed: 2/1/2013.", "P.

We propose a novel algorithm for automatic detection of OCR errors and improvement of retrieval performance from the erroneous corpus. Our algorithm does not use any training data or any language specific resources like thesaurus. It also does not use any knowledge about the language except that the word delimiter is blank space.

Even though traffic flow information is better than no traffic information, drivers still face dangerous congested traffic flow. Several approaches have addressed short-term traffic information in which a stigmergy-based approach is employed as an indirect communication method for cooperation among distributed agents and for managing traffic congestion. Recently, advances in Intelligent Transport Systems suggest a future in which vehicles handle their own positions. Our foresight-route-providing method combines a previous method that utilized the past travel times of vehicles for decentralized traffic congestion management. We assume that all vehicles collect dynamic traffic conditions in decentralized processing environments as real implementation environments during the simulations. In our simulations, we demonstrate that our assignment route strategies have the potential for significant efficiency and stability for traffic flow in decentralized processing environments that can collect dynamic traffic conditions from the previous few minutes and estimate the vehicle positions after a few minutes in only limited links. In this paper, we evaluate the differences between centralized and decentralized processing environments and investigate how the ratio of probe vehicles that are equipped with such devices as navigation systems is related to efficient and stable traffic flow. We confirmed that a route assignment strategy contributes to the stable efficiency of the total travel time. With more probe vehicles, assignment route strateges becomes efficient in our approach.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.139", "authors": ["Jun Takahashi\n,", "Ryo Kanamori\n,", "Takayuki Ito"], "references": ["T.

One open issue is how to effectively partition a large graph to process complex graph operations efficiently. In this paper, we present VB-Partitioner -- a distributed data partitioning model and algorithms for efficient processing of graph operations over large-scale graphs in the Cloud. Our VB-Partitioner has three salient features. First, it introduces vertex blocks (VBs) and extended vertex blocks (EVBs) as the building blocks for semantic partitioning of large graphs. Second, VB-Partitioner utilizes vertex block grouping algorithms to place those vertex blocks that have high correlation in graph structure into the same partition. Third, VB-Partitioner employs a VB-partition guided query partitioning model to speed up the parallel processing of graph pattern queries by reducing the amount of inter-partition query processing. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world graphs with millions of vertices and billions of edges. Our results show that VB-Partitioner significantly outperforms the popular random block-based data partitioner in terms of query latency and scalability over large-scale graphs.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2503210.2503302", "authors": ["Kisung Lee\n,", "Ling Liu"], "references": ["About FacetedDBLP. http://dblp.l3s.de/dblp++.php.", "BTC 2012 Dataset. http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2012/.", "Chaco: Software for Partitioning Graphs. http://www.sandia.gov/bahendr/chaco.html.", "DBpedia 3.8 Downloads. http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads38.", "METIS. http://www.cs.umn.edu/~metis.", "K.

These tables, however, are heterogeneous in structure, concepts, and metadata. One of the challenges in semantically extracting geographic data is the need to resolve these heterogeneities so as to uncover a conceptual hierarchy, metadata associated with instances, and geographic information---corresponding respectively to ontologies, elements that we call features, and cell values that can be used to identify geographic coordinates. In this paper, we present an architecture with methods to: (1) extract feature-rich web tables; (2) identify features; (3) construct a schema and instances using RDF; (4) perform geocoding. Preliminary experiments led to high accuracy in table identification and feature naming even when compared to manual evaluation.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2533888.2533939", "authors": ["Isabel F.

The usual strategy of sharing a public question is inefficient because it does not ensure an answer, either quality or agility. We assume that directing the question to a specific user is the best way to get a right and quick answer. However, choosing this person could be a hard task and by choosing a wrong one we could receive an incorrect answer or the person might just ignore the question. In this paper, we proposed, implemented and evaluated a model based on a multi-criteria approach to find the most suitable user to receive a question on Twitter. We rank expert candidates using the Weight Product Model. One of the main differentials of our model is the use of multi-criteria and that it was built for a social network context.

Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of identified topic domains for the purpose of finding relevant datasets, thus showing that our approach improves reusability of LOD datasets.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.206", "authors": ["Sarasi Lalithsena\n,", "Pascal Hitzler\n,", "Amit Sheth\n,", "Prateek Jain"], "references": ["D.

However, the IC Model assumes the effects of multiple neighbors on a node to be independent and does not consider the structural diversity of nodes' neighbourhood. In this paper, we propose an extension of the IC Model with the community structure of node neighbours incorporated. We derive an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the model parameters. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, we compared it with the IC model and its variants that do not consider the structural properties. Our empirical results based on the MemeTracker dataset, shows that after incorporating the structural diversity, there is a significant improvement in the modelling accuracy, with reasonable increase in run-time.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.61", "authors": ["Qing Bao\n,", "William K.

In particular, such opportunities are motivating public health researchers to improve the surveillance of disease epidemics by means of spatiotemporal analysis of social media geostreams. One essential requirement in achieving such geostream-based disease surveillance is to establish scalable data infrastructures capable of real-time transformation of massive geostreams into spatiotemporally organized data to which analytical methods are readily applicable. To fulfill this requirement, this study develops a data pipeline solution where multiple computational components are integrated to collect, process, and aggregate social media geostreams in near real time. As a test case, this solution focuses on one well-known social media geostream, the Twitter data stream, and one type of disease epidemics, the flu. The pipeline solution facilitates multiscale spatiotemporal analysis of flu risks by collecting geotagged tweets from the Twitter Streaming API, identifying flu-related tweets through keyword match, aggregating tweets at multiple spatial granularities in near real time, and storing tweets and the aggregate statistics in a distributed NoSQL database. Although developed for the surveillance of flu epidemics, the pipeline would serve as a general framework for building scalable data infrastructures that can support real-time spatiotemporal analysis of social media geostreams in the application domains beyond disease mapping and public health.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2534303.2534310", "authors": ["Myung-Hwa Hwang\n,", "Shaowen Wang\n,", "Guofeng Cao\n,", "Anand Padmanabhan\n,", "Zhenhua Zhang"], "references": ["Achrekar, H. et al. 2011.

The Random Surfer probability transition model, combined with Eigenvalue Centrality produced PageRank, which has shown to satisfy the required properties. Existing centrality measures (including PageRank) make the assumption that all directed edges are positive, implying an endorsement. Recent work on sentiment analysis has shown that this assumption is not valid. In this article, we introduce a new method of transitioning a graph, called Power Walk, that can successfully compute centrality scores for graphs with real weighted edges. We show that it satisfies the desired properties, and that its computation time and centrality ranking is similar to when using the Random Surfer model for non-negative matrices. Finally, stability and convergence analysis shows us that both stability and convergence when using the power method, are dependent on the Power Walk parameter β.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2537734.2537749", "authors": ["Laurence A.

Most multi-media based web applications are far from realizing their full potential largely due to the limitations of the traditional image compression methods. Representing a shape only based on its boundary information, the boundary-based shape descriptors are prospective for image compression. Inspired by how brain recalls objects, we propose a novel image compression scheme. This scheme can transform any boundary-based descriptor to its multi-resolution structure. The multi-resolution descriptor represents an image in a cognitive architecture which is idea for image compression with maintaining the global information and the key detail points of this image. This scheme has high computation accuracy and efficiency, strong flexibility, it is free from parameter settings, robust to errors and not restricted by the image formats.", "doi_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.137", "authors": ["Yanjun Zhao\n,", "Saeid Belkasim\n,", "Janani Krishnamani"], "references": ["A.
